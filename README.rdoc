This is the original code written for my senior thesis at NU http://mmss.wcas.northwestern.edu/thesis/articles/get/818/Williamson2013.pdf

If you're looking to replicate, you'll have a much better time using https://github.com/alexilliamson/go_verbal, where I am working on a well-tested, better-organized, more-intelligible-version that implements all the functionality seen here.
