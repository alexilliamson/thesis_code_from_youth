REV. HERBERT ANDERSON APPLAUDED FOR 15 YEARS OF SERVICE TO BRICK CHURCH

                                 ______


                        HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring to the attention of 
my colleagues the tremendous achievements of the Rev. Dr. Herbert B. 
Anderson.
  Dr. Anderson was installed as senior pastor of the Brick Presbyterian 
Church in the city of New York at a special convocation held on 
November 5, 1978. During the eventful succeeding period of 15 years, 
the pastorate of this cultivated Christian gentleman has been marked by 
a new spirit of community within the church, and a growing pattern of 
regeneration in the spiritual and secular affairs of the congregation. 
This is evidenced by a broad-based increase in church membership and 
stewardship, the growth of the church school and the day school, an 
abiding regard for the tradition of fine church music at Brick, an 
enhanced and more effective program of outreach to the areas of concern 
to the Brick Church in neighboring parts of our city, as well as the 
restoration and improvement of the church's physical properties. The 
past 15 years have also seen a significant increase in the Brick 
Church's endowment funds, the renewal of its commitment to serve 
others, and a continuing involvement in the affairs of their 
denomination at the local and national levels. All of these culminated 
in the last year's joyful celebration of the 225th anniversary to 
which, as ever, Dr. Anderson so felicitously devoted his time, talents, 
and enthusiasm.
  Throughout the period of his ministry at Brick, Dr. Anderson has 
reflected credit upon himself and the church by his participation in 
the affairs of the denomination and the community, including notable 
service as the first chair of the board of trustees of the Presbyterian 
Church (U.S.A.) Foundation, as chair of the committee organizing the 
bicentennial celebration of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), as chair 
of the board of trustees of McCormick Theological Seminary and as a 
trustee of Union Theological Seminary, Warren Wilson College, and 
Auburn Theological Seminary.
  Because the efforts of Dr. and Mrs. Anderson on behalf of the church 
have been so unstinting, because their affection and consideration for 
the church have been so enduring, and the fruits of their labors for 
the church have been so extraordinary, I would like my colleagues to 
join me in saluting Dr. and Mrs. Anderson for their 15 years of service 
to the Brick Presbyterian Church of New York and the entire community.

                          ____________________
