                   TRIBUTE TO PAGES OF 103D CONGRESS

                                 ______


                          HON. DALE E. KILDEE

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
express my personal gratitude to all of the pages who have served so 
diligently in the House of Representatives during the 103d Congress.
  We all recognize the important role that congressional pages play in 
helping the House of Representatives operate. This group of young 
people, who come from all across our Nation, represent what is good 
about our country. To become a page, these young people have proven 
themselves to be academically qualified. They have ventured away from 
the security of their homes and families to spend time in an unfamiliar 
city. Through this experience, they have witnessed a new culture, made 
new friends, and learned the details of how our Government operates.
  As we all know, the job of a congressional page is not an easy one. 
Along with being away from home, the pages must possess the maturity to 
balance competing demands for their time and energy. In addition, they 
must have the dedication to work long hours and the ability to interact 
with people at a personal level. At the same time, they face a 
challenging academic schedule of classes in the House Page School.
  The fall 1993 class of pages witnessed many important and historical 
events and debates, including the North American Free-Trade Agreement, 
the Brady bill, and President Clinton's address to Congress and the 
Nation on his health care reform proposal. The pages also witnessed the 
ceremonies commemorating the return of the Statue of Freedom to the 
Capitol dome. I am sure they will consider their time spent in 
Washington, DC to be one of the most valuable and exciting experiences 
of their lives, and that with this experience they will all move ahead 
to lead successful and productive lives.
  Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the House Page Board, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in honoring this group of distinguished young Americans. 
They certainly will be missed:
