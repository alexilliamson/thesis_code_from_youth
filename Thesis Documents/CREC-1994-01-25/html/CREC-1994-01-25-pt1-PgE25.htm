               THE BENEFITS OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING

                                 ______


                          HON. ELIZABETH FURSE

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Ms. FURSE. Mr. Speaker, I wish to bring to the attention of my 
colleagues the National Science Foundation publication, ``From Desktop 
to Teraflop: Exploiting the U.S. Lead in High Performance Computing.''
  This report is important for two reasons. First, it makes the 
benefits of high performance computing comprehensible. It explains how 
the investments we make in high performance computing are both prudent 
and beneficial. From the pharmaceutical, to the automotive, petroleum, 
and aerospace and defense industries, high performance computing has 
become a catalyst for U.S. industrial competitiveness.
  The second reason I highlight this report is that it provides 
information relevant to the June 1993 CBO report, ``Promoting High 
Performance Computing and Communications.'' That earlier report limited 
its evaluation of HPCC benefits to the computer industry alone and 
overlooked benefits that accrue to other industries that use high 
performance computing.
  The National Science Foundation report documents the success of the 
HPCC program and credits it for maintaining U.S. leadership in high 
performance computing.
