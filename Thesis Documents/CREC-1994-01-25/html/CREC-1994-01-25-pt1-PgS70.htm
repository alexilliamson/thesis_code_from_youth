  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, if there is no further business to come 
before the Senate at this time, I ask unanimous consent we stand in 
recess as previously ordered.
  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:43 p.m., recessed until 
8:35 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by 
the Presiding Officer [Mr. Campbell].
