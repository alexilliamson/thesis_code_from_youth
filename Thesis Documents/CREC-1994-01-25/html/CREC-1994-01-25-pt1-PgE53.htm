                A SPECIAL SALUTE TO MAYOR JOHN M. COYNE

                                 ______


                           HON. LOUIS STOKES

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. STOKES. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to pay tribute to a 
good friend and distinguished public servant, Mayor John M. Coyne. 
Mayor Coyne, the chief executive of the city of Brooklyn Heights, OH, 
is celebrating a landmark 55 consecutive years in public service. On 
Friday, February 4, 1994, a host of elected officials, community 
leaders, family, and friends will gather to pay tribute to this 
outstanding individual. I am pleased to participate in this special 
salute to Mayor Coyne.
  Mayor John M. Coyne currently holds the distinguished record of being 
the longest serving mayor in the United States. He was elected mayor of 
Brooklyn, OH, in 1947. During his 47 year tenure, he has been 
unsuccessfully opposed four times. Prior to his election as mayor, John 
Coyne held a 2-year term as treasurer of the city. He was also elected 
and served three 2-year terms as the clerk-auditor for the city of 
Brooklyn.
  Mr. Speaker, under John Coyne's leadership, Brooklyn has grown from a 
small, rural village to a prosperous, thriving city. It is due to Mayor 
Coyne's efforts that the city of Brooklyn offers its residents an array 
of city services including full-time police and fire protection, 
emergency medical services, weekly refuse and recycling collection, 
senior citizen snow removal and grass cutting, and a host of municipal 
facilities including a city hall, community senior center, and a state-
of-the-art recreation complex.
  John Coyne has devoted his efforts to increased safety and 
conservation. In 1966, Brooklyn became the home of the seat belt law 
when Mayor Coyne spearheaded mandatory legislation which has since been 
modeled around the Nation. In 1989, he authored legislation, now law, 
which prohibits the sale and possession of assault type weapons and 
provides a 7-day waiting period for weapons transactions within city 
limits. John Coyne has also taken a leadership role in the effort to 
encourage recycling. In 1990, the city of Brooklyn became the first 
community in the county and only the second in the State of Ohio, to 
institute a mandatory curbside recycling program. The program has 
proven successful throughout the city.
  I am proud to note that in addition to his duties as mayor, John 
Coyne has devoted his energies to strengthening the Democratic 
Party throughout the county and State. Since 1982, he has held the post 
as chairman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party. In this position, 
Mayor Coyne has served with the utmost ability, sense of fairness, and 
commitment. I, along with other elected officials, have benefited 
greatly from his strong leadership of our party, as well as his 
personal insight.

  Mayor Coyne is a member and former president of the Cuyahoga County 
Mayors and Managers Association. He is also a past member of the 
Cuyahoga County Board of Elections. Currently, Mayor Coyne serves as a 
member of the Ohio Mayors Association, Brooklyn Democratic Club, 
Southwest Council of Governments, Brooklyn Historical Society, 
Government Finance Officers Association, just to name a few.
  Mr. Speaker, Mayor John Coyne is the recipient of numerous awards for 
outstanding public service. He is the first recipient of the Ernest J. 
Bohn Award presented by the northeast Ohio chapter of the American 
Society for Public Administration for Outstanding Execution of Public 
Business. He was named ``Man of the Year'' by the Waterford Society and 
received the Irish Good Fellowship Club Award. Mayor Coyne was also 
selected as one of the first inductees into the Brooklyn High School 
Hall of Fame.
  Mayor Coyne gives credit to his wife, Jean, for giving him strength, 
encouragement and guidance throughout his 55 years in public service. 
The Coynes are the proud parents of four children--John, Ed, Penny, and 
Jim. They are also the proud grandparents of nine and great 
grandparents of three.
  Mr. Speaker, Mayor Coyne deserves special credit for his efforts to 
recognize the loyalty and dedication of black Democrats to the Cuyahoga 
County Democratic Party. Under his leadership, the black community made 
unprecedented gains in inclusion in elective office within the party 
structure, as well as elective office. This includes a seat on the 
Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, the chairmanship of the jury 
commission of Cuyahoga County, and jobs and judgeships. His 
chairmanship set an example for inclusion, affirmative action, and 
equal opportunity that will stand as a hallmark in Cleveland politics.
  I join his many supporters, family, and friends in saluting Mayor 
John M. Coyne. I also take this opportunity to wish him much continued 
success and to express my appreciation for his friendship.
