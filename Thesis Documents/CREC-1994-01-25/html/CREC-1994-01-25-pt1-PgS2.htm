                                 prayer

  The Senate Chaplain, the Reverend Richard C. Halverson, D.D., offered 
the following prayer:
  Let us pray:
  For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of 
God.--Romans 13:1.
  Eternal God, Lord of history, Sovereign of the nations, on this 1st 
day of the 2d session of the 103d Congress, we pray for a mighty 
visitation of the Holy Spirit upon our Nation. Men and women in 
leadership, whether it is the White House, the Congress, the Judiciary, 
or any position of power, are under the ordination of God. We pray for 
the President, the Vice President, the Members of Congress, and the 
Judiciary, and all who hold power in our Nation, that they may somehow 
be made aware of their accountability to God. They chose their 
position, they were elected or appointed, but they hold power by virtue 
of divine intervention. Help them take this fact seriously.
  Almighty God, Congress faces a very challenging year, a difficult 
agenda loaded with controversy, and there is always the daily 
possibility of a global crisis somewhere. Grant to Thy servants wisdom, 
strength, courage to fulfill their ultimate responsibility to Thy 
Living God.
  We pray this in the name of Him who is the Way, the Truth, and the 
Life. Amen.
