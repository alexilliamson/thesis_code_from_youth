                        TRIBUTE TO ALONZO SWANN

                                 ______


                        HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize Mr. 
Alonzo Swann, a World War II veteran and hero from Gary, IN.
  Mr. Swann was honored at the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. breakfast 
on Monday, January 17, 1994. Mr. Swan was awarded with the Navy's most 
prestigious medal, the Navy Cross.
  On October 29, 1944, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Intrepid came under 
attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft. The Japanese, using 
Kamikaze planes, crippled the aircraft carrier, impairing almost all of 
its anti-aircraft batteries. Swann's crew, comprised entirely of 
African-American servicemen, fought courageously, disabling the 
Kamikaze plane, and saving the Intrepid from destruction. Nine of 
Swann's 21-member crew died during the assault, and the remainder 
sustained serious injuries. Although wounded, Swann and the rest of the 
crew remained at their posts, fighting until the attack was over. I 
commend the courage of Mr. Swann and the crew in the rescue of the 
U.S.S. Intrepid, which has now become an historical relic.
  I would like to take this opportunity to honor Alonzo Swann, and all 
of the men of the U.S. Intrepid for their perseverance. Mr. Swann and 
the rest of the officers are men truly deserving of this long overdue 
recognition.
