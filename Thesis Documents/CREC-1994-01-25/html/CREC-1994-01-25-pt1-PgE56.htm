  A WELL DESERVED COMMUNITY TRIBUTE FOR DR. RONALD AND SYLVIA HARTMAN

                                 ______


                           HON. STEPHEN HORN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. HORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to two 
extraordinary leaders in the Long-Beach Lakewood area who are being 
honored by Temple Israel of Long Beach and who are also two dear 
friends. For 29 years, Dr. Ronald and Sylvia Hartman have been at the 
vanguard of building the Long Beach-Lakewood area as well as its 
medical community, its arts community, and its Jewish community. Both 
of the Hartmans are proven and accomplished leaders with impeccable 
judgment, breathtaking dynamism, and a sense of style and camaraderie 
which energizes everyone who works with them.
  Dr. Ron Hartman, born in Brooklyn, raised in Forest Hills, attended 
Cornell University and New York Medical School. Sylvia, born in 
Manhattan, was also raised in Forest Hills. Although they both attended 
Forest Hills High School, they did not meet until Ron's sister arranged 
a blind date while Ron was a first-year medical student and Sylvia was 
at Queen's College. Eight months later, Ron and Sylvia were married. 
Ron did his internship at Stamford, CT, and his residency at the 
University of Pennsylvania and the Harlem Eye and Ear Hospital.
  The Hartmans moved to Lakewood, CA in 1964. They immediately became 
involved in their new community--literally hitting the ground running.
  A distinguished ophthalmologist, Ron served as chief of staff of 
Lakewood Regional Medical Center and as chairman of the department of 
ophthalmology at the Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. He was also 
president of the Far Western Medical Association, Phi Delta Epsilon 
graduate medical fraternity, and the Long Beach Eye, Ear, Nose and 
Throat Society as well as treasurer of the Galen Medical Club. In 
addition to his private practice in ophthalmology, Ron is a clinical 
professor of ophthalmology at the University of California at Irvine 
where he received the department's 1993 ``Excellence in Teaching'' 
award. After four distinguished terms as president of Temple Israel in 
Long Beach, Ron is currently serving as vice president of the Temple 
Israel Foundation. Under his leadership and the leadership of Sylvia 
who served on the Temple's school board, the Temple has become one of 
the most celebrated synagogues in the southland area. Sharing an active 
interest in the arts with his wife, Ron has served as president of the 
Long Beach Museum of Art Foundation.
  Sylvia's volunteer activities are as daunting in their volume as they 
are in their substance. It was a pleasure to work with her on many 
activities when I was president of California State University, Long 
Beach. Sylvia served the university as president of the Fine Arts 
Affiliates and now acts as advisor to the group. She has made a 
significant leadership contribution to the University Art Museum as a 
board member. She has chaired the art department advisory board and has 
served on the School of Health Sciences' advisory board.
  Sylvia is currently in her second term as a member of the board of 
directors of the Long Beach Museum of Art Foundation, where she serves 
on its executive committee. She has held numerous leadership roles on 
behalf of the Long Beach Museum: as chairman of the directors circle, 
as president of Phoenix, the Museum's major support group, and as 
current chairman of the Trustees and Officers Nominating Committee. 
Sylvia has not only made a mark in the visual arts but has also had a 
great impact on the performing arts in the Long Beach-Lakewood area 
serving as an executive board member of the Long Beach Opera and as co-
chairman of the Opera Ring. Given her sterling achievements in building 
the visual and the performing arts in the community and her vibrancy 
and dynamism as an arts advocate, it is no surprise that Sylvia is the 
1993 recipient of the Public Corporation for the Arts ``Distinguished 
Arts Volunteer of the Year'' award for the City of Long Beach.
  In addition to raising four sons, Sylvia was also a Cub Scout Den 
Mother for 9 years, a homeowners association president in Sun Valley, 
ID, for 5 years, and has been heavily involved in the Jewish community 
with the National Council of Jewish Women (Chair of Charter Day) and 
chairman of the Diamond Circle Division for the women's Division of the 
Long Beach Jewish Federation. Sylvia is also ways and means chair for 
Cameo, the professional auxiliary of the Assistance League of Long 
Beach, and she serves on the California Republican Party State Central 
Committee. On top of this impressive array of community activities, 
Sylvia works full time as a real estate broker associated with Dolphin 
Properties in Long Beach.
  The Hartmans have four brilliant and super-achieving sons. The 
eldest, Carl, is an ophthalmologist in private practice with his 
father. Carl is married to Elise. Bruce--who has a master's in computer 
science--works in research and development for Bell Laboratories in 
Columbus, OH, and has received awards for excellence. Bruce is married 
to Julie. Gregg is currently in his orthopedics residency at the 
University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and is married to Sharon. Glenn 
is now completing his master's of fine arts degree at Tulane University 
in New Orleans. The Hartmans have three adorable grandchildren: Shelby 
Anne, age 3\1/2\; Sarah Jeanette, who is almost 2; and Jordan Myles, 
who just turned 1.
  Mr. Speaker, the Hartmans' 29 years of leadership and dedication to 
the cities of Long Beach and Lakewood, the medical community, the arts 
community, and the Jewish community have truly set the standard for all 
who know them and who work with them. Whether working on community 
projects separately or together, their energy, style, and sense of 
mission have made them role models in the area.
  As Temple Israel of Long Beach honors Dr. Ron and Sylvia Hartman for 
their tremendous leadership in helping build their community and the 
synagogue, I am proud to join their many friends and extraordinary 
family in wishing them the very best for success in all their 
continuing activities which so notably strengthen and enhance our 
communities, the medical profession, the visual and performing arts, 
and American Jewish life.
