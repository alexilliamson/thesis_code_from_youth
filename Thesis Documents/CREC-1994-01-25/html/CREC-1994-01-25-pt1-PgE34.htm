                    TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL D. NARDIELLO

                                 ______


                            HON. HERB KLEIN

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. KLEIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Michael D. 
Nardiello, a man who has given instruction and counsel to thousands of 
students in the community of Belleville, NJ. I am very proud to join 
the Belleville School District in thanking him for his 42 years of 
service.
  Mr. Nardiello received his B.A. from Montclair State College and 
graduated in 1950. In addition, he attended Seton Hall University where 
he received his M.A. in special education.
  Immediately after leaving Montclair State, Mr. Nardiello began his 
lifelong commitment to Belleville. In 1951, he became a teacher in 
school No. 4, and he was later named the supervisor of special 
education. In 1968, he became the principal of school No. 4.
  Mr. Nardiello continued his dedication to Belleville throughout his 
career. In 1980, he was named the assistant superintendent for school 
personnel. Three years later, he became the superintendent of schools 
until his retirement 10 years later in December 1993.
  For decades, Belleville has benefited from the positive influence Mr. 
Nardiello has provided to students, parents, and teachers, and I know 
he will be deeply missed. For his valued effort, I join with my 
colleagues in wishing him many more wonderful years and continued 
success.
