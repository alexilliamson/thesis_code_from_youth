              A JOB TRAINING PROGRAM FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

                                 ______


                            HON. DON EDWARDS

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. EDWARDS of California. Mr. Speaker, as we return to Congress and 
prepare to consider welfare reform and job training legislation, it is 
imperative that we take another look at what will work best to break 
the inherent cycle of poverty facing our Nation. As our industries 
continue to change, high school dropout rates remain high, and the 
number of impoverished Americans increases, we here in Congress have a 
responsibility to enact public policy that confronts these problems.
  The Center for Employment Training [CET], founded 27 years ago in my 
San Jose district, has taken a nontraditional approach that deserves 
careful examination. CET's training curriculum emphasizes the 
development of hands-on vocational skills while simultaneously 
integrating basic reading, math, and communication skills. Several 
studies have found that the CET model is not only cost effective, but 
extremely successful at meeting its program goals of significantly 
increasing employment and earnings for its graduates.
  Recently, the San Jose Mercury News had an interesting editorial 
seeking further Federal investment in CET-model programs. I'm sure our 
colleagues will find much food for thought in this editorial, which I 
am pleased to enter into the Record.
  The article follows:

             [From the San Jose Mercury News, Jan. 6, 1994]

   Job Training That Works--Standout San Jose Program Deserves More 
                                Funding

       What does San Jose have that was invented in a garage, and 
     has people in 48 U.S. cities, Chile, Belize and Mexico 
     standing in line for?
       If you guessed personal computers, you're wrong. The answer 
     is a spot in a job program run by or supervised by the Center 
     for Employment Training.
       CET began 26 years ago in East San Jose with an unorthodox 
     approach to the elusive goal of turning welfare recipients 
     into workers. Instead of offering popular and easy remedial 
     English and math classes, CET stresses tangible skills. No 
     matter how well men or women read and write, they quickly get 
     their hands on typewriters, circuit boards, kitchen ovens and 
     machine tools.
       It works.
       When the Manpower Demonstration Research Corp. in New York 
     measured 15 training programs for disadvantaged high school 
     dropouts, CET received the only passing grade. CET graduates 
     saw their earnings increase $6,700 over four years, far above 
     the average of $214. Two years ago the Rockefeller Foundation 
     called CET's success with young mothers a national model.
       It Really works.
       The government of Chile has formally invited CET to start a 
     center. Belize already has one. Mexican government officials 
     have visited CET's headquarters and training center in San 
     Jose. The Clinton administration has awarded CET $1 million 
     to replicate its method in 10 new cities. CET already 
     operates centers in 28 cities coast to coast and has placed 
     60,000 graduates.
       So why just a measly $1 million more from Washington? In a 
     quarter century, CET has outperformed a legion of federally 
     funded job-training programs that squandered billions.
       As the Clinton welfare reformers prepare their initiatives, 
     it's clear Washington must cut loose the failed approaches 
     and reward the one that succeed. CET is one of the nation's 
     very few standouts.
