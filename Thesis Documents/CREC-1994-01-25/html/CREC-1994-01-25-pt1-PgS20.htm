            IRRESPONSIBLE CONGRESS? HERE'S TODAY'S BOX SCORE

  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, along another line for just a moment. As a 
Senator from North Carolina, I have begun presenting to the Senate each 
day for the third year what I call the box score on Federal deficit 
spending.
  I started this on February 25, 1992. I reported the precise, exact 
Federal debt run up by the Congress of the United States down to the 
penny. The first report was on February 25. The latest report we had 
available on February 25 was the close of business of February 21, 
1992. As of February 21, 1992, the Federal debt stood at $3 trillion--
$3,823,909,309,474.57.
  At the close of business yesterday, Mr. President, the Federal debt 
stood at $4,506,790,072,963.29. That means that since February 21, 1992 
the Federal debt has increased by $682,880,763,488.72.
  This means that on per capita basis, as of today, with the debt, and 
I repeat, as of close of business yesterday standing at 
$4,506,790,072,963.29--that means that on a per capita basis every man, 
woman, and child in the United States owes $17,286.54 as his or her 
share of that national debt.
  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.
