  Mr. GEPHARDT. Mr. Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution (H. Res.

       Resolved, That a committee of two Members be appointed by 
     the Speaker on the part of the House of Representatives to 
     join with a committee on the part of the Senate to notify the 
     President of the United States that a quorum of each House 
     has assembled and Congress is ready to receive any
