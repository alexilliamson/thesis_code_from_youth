     THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST YEAR: TOO MANY BITTER THINGS TO SWALLOW

  (Mr. HORN asked and was given permission to address the House and to 
revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HORN. Mr. Speaker, tonight when the President gives his State of 
the Union address, you can expect that he will put a positive spin on 
his first year in office. But let us not kid ourselves; the President's 
first year in office has not been all rosy, especially for the middle 
class.
  Here is a quick review: His promise to give the middle class a tax 
cut was quickly abandoned.
  His economic package is a rerun of taxes and spending.
  Too many of his foreign policy initiatives have been an unmitigated 
disaster.
  His welfare reform plan is nonexistent.
  Indeed, the whereabouts of his crime plan is a mystery which even 
Sherlock Holmes could not solve.
  His health care reform bill is the wrong prescription for the wrong 
diagnosis.
  The President is very good at adding a spoonful of sugar and making 
lemonade out of old lemons. But his first year in office has been full 
of lemons for the middle-class taxpayer--and even his lemonade--despite 
its sugary rhetoric--is a bitter thing for the taxpayers to swallow.
