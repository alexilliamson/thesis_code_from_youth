           CONGRATULATIONS TO KEVIN CHIARAMONTE, EAGLE SCOUT

                                 ______


                         HON. THOMAS J. MANTON

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. MANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 19-year-old 
Kevin Chiaramonte of Middle Village, NY, for achieving the highest 
honor in Scouting, becoming an Eagle Scout.
  To become an Eagle Scout, one must meet a number of requirements. 
These include attaining 20 merit badges and displaying leadership in 
school, Scouting, and the community. Kevin has demonstrated his 
leadership abilities not only in the Scouting community, but in the 
social and educational communities as well.
  Kevin was born in Brooklyn, NY, and attended elementary school at St. 
Margaret's in Middle Village, NY, and continued at the Regis High 
School where he received a full scholarship. While in these two 
institutions of learning he took part in chorus, drama, high school 
C.C.D. programs, and of course, Boy Scouts. Currently, he is working 
toward receiving his bachelors degree from Boston University.
  Kevin's Scouting career consisted of 5 years in Cub Scouts and 7 
years as a Boy Scout. While in the Scouting program he has held 
numerous leadership positions, including patrol leader, assistant 
senior patrol leader, senior patrol leader, and quartermaster. He has 
received 2 religious awards, over 21 merit badges, and 11 skill awards 
while a Scout and has received the highest Scouting honor Eagle Scout 
this past July. I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating 
Kevin on becoming an Eagle Scout.
