  HOUSE SALUTES HANK BAUER, YANKEE GREAT AND ``TOUGHEST OF THE TOUGH''

                                 ______


                        HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, ``Toughest of the tough.'' That's how 
everyone who has known Hank Bauer describes him. That's the kind of 
marine he was for 34 months in the Pacific. And that's the way he 
played baseball for 11 years with the Yankees and later led the 
Baltimore Orioles to a pennant.
  I suppose some of you who are fans of teams the Yankees dominated 
during their golden years wanted to forget all about Hank Bauer. After 
the Yankees brought him up he joined an outfield that already featured 
Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle. During his career, Hank Bauer went to 
nine World Series and broke several records. He played fair and he 
played hard. That's the way he did everything.
  He was never too busy to help the Marine Corps in their annual ``Toys 
for Tots'' campaigns. That's what we might expect from someone who 
earned a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts in such places 
as Guadalcanal, Tinian, and Okinawa. He's still carrying some shrapnel 
he picked up in Okinawa.
  Last October 27, Hank Bauer was operated on for cancer. I've been 
told that the operation was successful, but that long months of 
rehabilitation are ahead. But Hank Bauer has already faced the rigors 
of combat and pitchers the likes of Bob Feller and Warren Spahn. We can 
be sure he will attack rehabilitation like he has everything else in 
life.
  Mr. Speaker, I may be a die-hard Dodgers fan, but I'm still proud to 
ask this body to join me in wishing Hank Bauer, the pride of the 
Yankees and an outstanding marine, a speedy recovery. Semper fi, Hank.
