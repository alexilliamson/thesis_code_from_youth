        COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 1150--GOALS 2000 EDUCATE AMERICA ACT

<bullet> Mr. RIEGLE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the 
important issue of education and how our education system in the United 
States can be enhanced by the passage of S. 1150--Goals 2000: Educate 
America Act. Two recent studies highlight just how important education 
is to our country and to its citizens. Last fall Education Secretary 
Richard Riley released a study indicating that only 59 percent of our 
fourth graders could meet basic reading standards for their age, and 
that 75 percent of our high school seniors could meet their basic 
standards. These figures are even more alarming in light of the fact 
that many of the kids in dire need of improvement have already dropped 
out of school by grade 12.
  While analysis of our education system usually centers on school 
children 18 and younger, a second study confirms that substandard 
education does indeed have an ongoing negative impact on our citizens 
and on the country as a whole. This survey, which has been described as 
the most comprehensive study of adult literacy in the United States in 
over two decades, provides evidence of how education, employment, 
citizenship and the well being of our Nation are intertwined.
  According to this study, roughly half or 47 percent of adult 
Americans fell into the lowest two of five literacy levels. These 
adults can perform only the most simple reading and writing tasks; one-
fifth of those surveyed ranked in the lowest literacy level. For these 
adults--an estimated 40 million Americans nationwide--it is impossible 
to determine the total cost of a purchase, to locate an intersection on 
a map, or enter information on a simple form. Tragically these 
Americans fell through the cracks of our education system, and continue 
to fall through the cracks of our society--experiencing high 
unemployment, high poverty rates, and little hope of self-improvement.
  We have an opportunity to do something about these troubling numbers 
and to ensure that today's young people will receive the basic skills 
they need. In 1989, a bipartisan group of State and national leaders 
gathered to form what we now refer to as Goals 2000. Over the past few 
years, the spirit in which these goals were drawn up has been enhanced 
by the bipartisanship and broad support these goals have received.
  The Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources has strengthened 
these goals, making very clear that parental involvement and State and 
local control are critical elements in the education of our children. 
And while Washington cannot offer any magic solutions or silver bullet 
answers to our troubled education system, we can do what we must do--
offer leadership and provide assistance.
  This legislation has received broad national support that includes 
parent groups, business organizations, labor unions, school 
administrators, boards of education, and Governors. S. 1150 codifies 
the national education standards that were formed by that 1989 meeting 
between the Governors and the President. By enacting these standards we 
make clear that education is a top priority for our country, and I 
believe we enhance our chances of reaching these goals as we enter the 
21st century.
  It is important to highlight the words that are included in the 
purpose of this legislation: ``Creating a vision of excellence and 
equity that will guide all Federal education and related programs.'' It 
is time that we stepped up to that responsibility and assisted our 
communities, school systems, and families in creating that vision. Some 
will argue that this is Government interference or another Federal 
mandate, but the reality is that this bill does not contain mandates 
and in fact gives the Secretary of Education the power to grant 
important waivers if Federal regulations are impeding critical reform 
efforts at the State and local level. Instead of mandates, this bill 
provides incentives and financial help to States that are striving to 
reform their education systems.
  This legislation is also important because it recognizes the role of 
education in our work force and how that education directly affects our 
economy. Included in this bill are provisions to help States create 
their own improvement plans, assistance in professional development, 
and a number of provisions that tie our education system to the economy 
including the establishment of a National Skills Standards Board. While 
continuing the theme of the voluntary nature of this legislation, we 
make a statement that we are willing to offer the leadership and 
direction that education has been lacking.
  I endorse this bill because it is time for this Nation to move ahead, 
it is time for the country to look toward the year 2000 with a goal of 
greatness. I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to 
the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Edward Kennedy and the 
other Members of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources--
both Democrats and Republicans--who worked very hard at crafting a bill 
that has such broad bipartisan and national support.<bullet>
