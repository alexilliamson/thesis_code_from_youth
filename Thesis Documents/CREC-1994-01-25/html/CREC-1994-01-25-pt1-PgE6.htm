                        HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize 
James and Imogene Harris.
  James and Imogene were honored at the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. 
breakfast sponsored by the Gary Frontiers Service Club on Monday, 
January 17, 1994. The couple received the highest distinction bestowed 
by the club, the Drum Major Award.
  The Drum Major Award is awarded to members of the community who have 
committed themselves to the elimination of inequality, prejudice, and 
racism. Recipients of this award have demonstrated long-term dedication 
to their community by assisting in the eradication of injustice.
  Leaders in the African-American community, James and Imogene Harris 
have been providing Gary with 32 years of uninterrupted circulation of 
the Gary Info News. A weekly publication, the Info has been 
instrumental in upholding Gary's issues, affirmative action concerns, 
and equal opportunity affairs. James and Imogene have dedicated their 
lives to the betterment of Gary's African-American community, and have 
shared their publication with Gary to unite its citizens against 
injustice, inequality, prejudice, and racism.
  I would like to take this opportunity to commend James and Imogene 
Harris in their 30-year commitment to instill equality and justice 
throughout the city of Gary, IN.
