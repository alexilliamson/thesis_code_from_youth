                         TRIBUTE TO TOM MULLON

                                 ______


                            HON. JIM RAMSTAD

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. RAMSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to Tom 
Mullon, a resident of my district who is retiring after a highly 
distinguished career with the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA].
  Tom has served the VA for more than 30 years. During that time, he 
has deeply influenced the course the VA has taken in the Midwest.
  Since joining the VA in 1962, Tom has occupied many responsible 
positions, including that of VA Regional Director for the Midwestern 
Region.
  The capstone of his career was overseeing the planning, construction, 
activation, and opening of the Minneapolis VA Medical Center [VAMC], a 
$240 million construction project which gave the Midwest a truly 
premier facility in the VA hospital system.
  Tom was the driving force behind the establishment of the Brain 
Sciences Center, a research facility housed at the Minneapolis VAMC. 
Additionally, Tom was responsible for the opening of numerous clinics 
and health centers, proving himself a true friend and advocate of 
veterans.
  Even though Tom is retiring from the VA, I am sure he will continue 
to contribute to the VA and the veterans community through his tireless 
efforts on the various councils, task forces, and numerous other 
projects on which he works.
  Mr. Speaker, I highly commend Mr. Mullon for his efforts in the VA 
and his influence on the communities in the Midwest, and truly which 
him all the best in all his future endeavors.

                          ____________________
