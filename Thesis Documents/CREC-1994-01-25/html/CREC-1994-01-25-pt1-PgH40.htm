                              HERE TO STAY

  (Mr. FROST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, the word out of Dallas-Fort Worth 
was ``The Boyz are Back.'' After Sunday's victory over the San 
Francisco 49'ers, we know that the Cowboys are ``Here to Stay.''
  In recent years, Super Bowl champions have come and gone. In fact, 
many teams have struggled to even make the playoffs the year after they 
win the Super Bowl. With a tougher schedule, injuries and complacency 
to overcome, defending champions have often folded.
  However, the Dallas Cowboys showed what they were made of this 
season. They overcame all of these obstacles and more to return to the 
Super Bowl and defend their title. At the beginning of the season, with 
Emmitt Smith out because of a contract dispute, the team was 0-2 and 
sports writers across the country were having a field day with the 
demise of yet another defending champion.
  Undaunted by the challenge and with Emmitt Smith back in the lineup, 
the Cowboys quickly sent notice to the rest of the league that they 
were not going to fold by winning 7 straight games and 14 of their next 
16. They accomplished this despite injuries to Pro-Bowlers Troy Aikman, 
Emmitt Smith, Mark Stepnoski, and Ken Norton. The Cowboys have shown 
the character of a true champion this season and we in the Dallas-Fort 
Worth area are very proud to call them ``Our Team.''
