 RECOGNITION OF THE BROOKHAVEN ACADEMY COUGARS' FIRST STATE 2A ACADEMY 
                         FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP

                                 ______


                            HON. MIKE PARKER

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. PARKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in 
honoring an outstanding group of young men, the Brookhaven Academy 
Cougar football team of Brookhaven, MS, and their coaches, supporters, 
fans and parents on winning the school's first-ever Class 2A 
Mississippi Private School Football Championship.
  The Cougars on November 19, 1993, defeated the Greenville Christian 
School Saints in a 21-18 victory for Lincoln County's first State 
football title. The Cougars, led by alumnus Coach Herbert Davis Jr., 
came from behind with less than 7 minutes left in the championship 
game. A cliffhanger ending nearly occurred but, with 3 seconds left in 
the game, the Saints missed a field goal that would have tied the 
score, and the Cougars marched on to victory. I applaud the players on 
both the Brookhaven and Greenville teams for their courage and 
sportsmanship and their fans for their devotion to the teams, their 
schools and the sport itself. The Brookhaven Academy Cougars exemplify 
the American spirit of competition, fair play and pride.
  Their supporters also deserve praise--the fans for their unwavering 
pride and spirit; the parents for supporting and encouraging their 
children and taking the responsibility of ensuring players, 
cheerleaders, band members and student volunteers are able to attend 
each practice and game; and the coaches and teachers for their positive 
leadership, understanding and guidance in this championship and in 
their efforts to help all students experience academic excellence.
  I ask you to join me in saluting the Brookhaven Academy Cougars for 
their dedication to excellence, their positive attitudes and pride in 
their school and in Mississippi.
