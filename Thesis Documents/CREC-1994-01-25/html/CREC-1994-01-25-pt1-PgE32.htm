                               H.R. 3583

                                 ______


                          HON. SAM COPPERSMITH

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. COPPERSMITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3583, a bill 
to make certain non-Federal levees eligible for assistance under the 
Federal Levee Rehabilitation Program, and want the record to reflect my 
understanding of the purpose and intent of this legislation.
  To qualify for assistance under H.R. 3583, a non-Federal levee must 
meet Army Corps of Engineers criteria for operation, maintenance, and 
design. Furthermore, the levee must meet economic justifications and 
have a public sponsor. In short, the bill does not seek to breach 
existing law governing levee rehabilitation.
  Under this bill, before qualifying for Federal repair funds, a levee 
must meet all substantive Corps requirements for the existing 
rehabilitation program. This bill will provide repair funds only to 
levees with minor non-material compliance problems, such as a failure 
to submit paperwork several years ago. Moreover, the public sponsors 
shall demonstrate sufficient financial resources to ensure that proper 
maintenance of the non-Federal levee will continue.
  In addition, H.R. 3583 in no way conflicts with the administration's 
August 23 memorandum to the Corps and other relevant agencies 
instructing them to consider non-structural alternatives and design 
modifications that could provide greater local benefits of flood 
control, reduction of future potential flood damage to the public 
sponsor, as well as to adjacent areas upstream and downstream, lower 
long-term costs to the Federal Government, and natural resource 
protection.
  As this legislation allows consideration of the future risk of 
failure, projected relief costs, and consideration of alternatives, and 
in no way conflicts with the August 23 memorandum, I am pleased to 
support H.R. 3583.
  Finally, I salute the hard work by Representative Danner, as well as 
Representative Boehlert, Chairman Applegate, ranking member Shuster and 
Chairman Mineta in crafting this important and balanced legislation.

                          ____________________
