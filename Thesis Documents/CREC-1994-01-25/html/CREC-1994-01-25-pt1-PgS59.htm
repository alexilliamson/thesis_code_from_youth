                      HONORING LT. ADAM S. LEVITT

 Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an 
extraordinary New Yorker, Lt. Adam S. Levitt. Lieutenant Levitt has the 
distinct honor of receiving a sea-going command while still a 
lieutenant when the fourth of thirteen Cyclone-class ships, the U.S.S. 
Monsoon, is christened this month. This is quite an honor and a great 
opportunity for early and major responsibility.
  Lt. Adam S. Levitt, a native of Malverne, NY, graduated from the U.S. 
Naval Academy in 1984 with a bachelor of science degree in operations 
analysis. Upon commissioning he reported to U.S.S. John Young as damage 
control assistant, and later served as gunnery officer and main 
propulsion assistant until his transfer to naval postgraduate school in 
1988.
  Lieutenant Levitt received his master of science degree in 
information systems management in 1989 and was awarded the Admiral 
Grace Hopper award. Following graduate school, he reported to surface 
warfare school in Newport, RI and then joined the U.S. Merrill which 
was deployed to the Persian Gulf in May 1991.
  Lieutenant Levitt reported to new construction duty in July 1992 as 
prospective commanding officer of the fourth Cyclone Class Patrol 
Coastal (PC) Ship, U.S.S. Monsoon. Command of each of the 13 Cyclone-
class ships is available to surface warfare-qualified lieutenants, like 
Adam Levitt, serving in their second department head tours. At-sea 
commands usually require their commanding officers to be at least a 
lieutenant commander who has already served two department head tours.
  Navy officials discovered a need for a small, fast patrol boat that 
could pursue minelayers, patrol against terrorists in motor boats and 
launch special operations forces in small motor boats. The answer came 
in the form of a Vosper Thornycroft design which is being built by 
Bolinger Shipyard in Lockport, LA. The PC class ships are named after 
elements of weather.
  PCO Lt. Adam S. Levitt will take command of the Monsoon in San Diego 
on January 22, 1994. I salute Lieutenant Levitt as he enters a new 
level in his career. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Lt. 
Adam Levitt for his dedication and commitment to the U.S. Navy and the 
United States of America.
