                        TRIBUTE TO JERRY CREMINS

                                 ______


                         HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to my close 
friend Jerry Cremins, who has been a leader in the building trades in 
California since 1969. Jerry is retiring this year. Before that, he was 
a representative for the plumbers union in Los Angeles. Jerry has 
always reinforced my own beliefs in the importance of labor unions to 
the economic well being of working men and women in America.
  Jerry's life has been dedicated to bettering the lives of American 
workers. I have been honored to work with him on a number of issues 
important to the labor movement and have always found Jerry to be 
tough-minded but fair, a capable and accomplished representative of 
labor's interests in the political arena.
  Jerry has enjoyed a distinguished career in the labor movement. In 
1976 he became executive secretary of the Los Angeles Building Trades 
Council; 7 years later he was elected president of the State Building 
and Construction Trades Council of California, which represented 24 
local building trades councils and over 40,000 members in the State.
  Unions have accomplished much in the country--and can do so again 
with leaders of the quality of Jerry Cremins. With hard work, 
perseverance, and intelligence--qualities Jerry has in abundance--the 
rights of working men and women can be safeguarded.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Jerry Cremins, a towering 
figure in the labor movement in southern California, a wise and shrewd 
leader and a good friend.
