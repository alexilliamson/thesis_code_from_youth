THE 1994 KING HOLIDAY OBSERVANCE: ``STOP THE KILLING; START THE HEALING 
                             AND BUILDING''

                                 ______


                         HON. THOMAS C. SAWYER

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. SAWYER. Mr. Speaker, last week we observed the 65th anniversary 
of the birth of one of America's greatest leaders, Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr.
  The King holiday provides us with the opportunity to renew our 
commitment to Dr. King's dream of achieving peace, racial harmony, 
cultural tolerance, and equality of economic opportunity.
  The observance of Dr. King's birthday is coordinated through the 
tireless efforts of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal Holiday 
Commission, on which I have the pleasure of serving. In addition to 
promoting the King holiday, the Commission has devoted countless hours 
to passing on Dr. King's legacy and teachings to our children, who will 
shape the future of the community of nations.
  With its limited resources, the Commission sponsors activities 
throughout the year aimed at combating violence, crime, drugs, and 
illiteracy, as well as promoting voter registration and urban economic 
development. The Commission also places a heavy emphasis on educating 
our young people about alternatives to violence and crime and teaching 
them the skills they need to settle disputes and conflicts 
nonviolently.
  If Dr. King were here today, what would he think of our society and 
our world? Conditions have improved since his untimely death. However, 
we continue to grapple with issues such as racism, the lack of 
affordable health care, and senseless acts of violence that are growing 
at an alarming pace.
  I believe that it is time for all of us to practice the politics of 
inclusion, so that Americans of all races and ethnic backgrounds may 
share in the challenge of economic recovery and social healing.
  That is why I sponsored the ``King Holiday and Service Act,'' along 
with a good friend, Congressman John Lewis of Georgia. The Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Federal Holiday Commission is scheduled to expire in 
April. H.R. 1933 would extend the life of the Commission for 5 years. I 
believe that enactment of this legislation is necessary because the 
Commission still has an important role to play in making the King 
holiday a meaningful and inclusive observance for all Americans.
