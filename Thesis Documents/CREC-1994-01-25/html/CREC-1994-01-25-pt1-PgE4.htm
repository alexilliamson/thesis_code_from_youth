                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, in the rough and tumble business of 
simply doing business, I am proud to report that the economic climate 
in my home city of Santa Fe, NM is such that new businesses are 
sprouting up in this new year.
  One such new venture is Santa Fe Business, a new bimonthly newspaper 
which will debut on President's Day, February 21. The main goal of this 
new publication is to help Santa Fe's businesses do better and play 
some part in increasing the economic strength of not only New Mexico's 
capital city, but the entire State as well.
  I congratulate Santa Fe Business publisher Susan Bodenstein for 
starting this important business which is designed to help other small 
businesses succeed in these competitive times.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the Susan Bodensteins of 
our Nation who are undertaking risks, investing their money and time, 
starting businesses, hiring workers, and helping make our country and 
our people prosper.

                          ____________________
