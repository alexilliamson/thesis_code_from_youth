     TRIBUTE TO ALEXANDER J. HEBERT, RETIRING VETERANS' EMPLOYMENT 
                             REPRESENTATIVE

                                 ______


                            HON. DICK SWETT

                            of new hampshire

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. SWETT. Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me today in 
paying tribute to Alexander J. Hebert--an outstanding employee of the 
New Hampshire Employment Security Department for over 30 years.
  Mr. Speaker, Alexander J. Hebert retired on December 9, 1993 
following 37 years of service in Employment Security. Beginning as a 
mail clerk and then as a claims taker, Alex has spent the last 25 years 
as a Veterans' Employment Representative.
  As a veteran of the Korean war, Alex truly understood the needs of 
his fellow veterans. For the past 25 years he has been dedicated to 
providing them with services and counseling. This dedication has gained 
him the respect of veterans throughout New Hampshire. In addition, many 
employers throughout the State have grown to respect and appreciate 
Alex for his willingness to assist them with their employment needs.
  Alex was recently honored with a certificate of appreciation from the 
Department of Labor for having achieved all requirements in the 
Veterans' Compliance Standards for 1992. This is in addition to the 
countless letters of thanks he has received from veterans and 
employers.
  Mr. Speaker, Alexander J. Hebert exemplifies the rock-solid values 
that are typical of the people of New Hampshire. His loyalty, 
dedication, and hard work deserve our respect and our recognition. I 
urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Alexander J. Hebert for his 
lifetime of contributions to the citizens of New Hampshire.
