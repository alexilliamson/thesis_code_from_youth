                     JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS

  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 
197, providing for a joint session of the Congress, just received from 
the House; that the concurrent resolution be agreed to; and that the 
motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  So the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 197) was agreed to.
