                      A TRIBUTE TO AMOCO CHEMICAL

                                 ______


                       HON. GEORGE E. SANGMEISTER

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. SANGMEISTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of 
the business cornerstones in my district, Amoco Chemicals of Joliet, 
IL, which will also be recognized Feb. 7 by the Joliet Region Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry with its annual salute to Industry Award.
  Although Amoco Chemicals is a subsidiary of one of the biggest 
corporations in the world, it is firmly focused on the community in 
which it has been located since 1958. The company has blended 
employment opportunities, research and community involvement in making 
its mark on the Joliet region.
  Amoco Chemicals employs more than 500 area residents in high-paying 
jobs producing chemicals used in the production of food service 
containers, wire coatings, fiberglass, paint, oil additives and other 
industrial and consumer products. Amoco is continuously improving the 
quality of its products through the input of its employees, suppliers 
and customers.
  In addition to its outstanding reputation for quality manufacturing, 
Amoco Chemicals encourages its employees to make an investment in the 
community. Employees volunteer their time through the Amoco-Culbertson 
Education Partnership and the United Way of Will County. Amoco also has 
been a generous underwriter of local civic and charitable causes, such 
as Special Olympics, the Boy Scouts, Joliet Junior College and many 
other worthy organizations. The company awarded the Joliet/Will County 
Center for Economic Development, an organization designed to strengthen 
the local economy, $150,000 to fund its efforts.
  Amoco is also a good neighbor. It has organized the Citizens' 
Advisory Panel, where 10 local residents meet regularly with the plant 
manager to discuss the plant's activities and how they impact the 
community. Amoco has also been at the forefront in reducing its waste 
emissions with innovative programs.
  Mr. Speaker, I salute Amoco Chemicals on its contributions to our 
local economy and its involvement in the community of Joliet and 
congratulate the company on its well-deserved Salute to Industry Award.
