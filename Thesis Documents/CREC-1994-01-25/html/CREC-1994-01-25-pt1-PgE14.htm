                         TRIBUTE TO SCOTT ALEVY

                                 ______


                            HON. BOB FILNER

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Scott Alevy of Chula 
Vista, CA, the founder and president of Citizens Revolting Against 
Airport Siting Hype--also know as CRASH. When powerful special 
interests tried to impose a new airport in my district, an airport 
which would create serious noise, pollution, and traffic impacts on the 
people I represent, Mr. Alevy led a grassroots citizen effort to 
restore common sense.
  Under Mr. Alevy's leadership, CRASH held meetings, wrote letters, 
published articles, gathered information, circulated petitions, issued 
press releases, and ensured that the voice of ordinary people would 
prevail. Because of Mr. Alevy's tireless efforts, the citizens of Chula 
Vista and the entire South Bay region will finally have confidence that 
the integrity and character of their neighborhoods will not be 
compromised by a misguided airport plan.
  Recently, Mr. Alevy was asked to explain his motive for giving up so 
much of his personal time and privacy to lead this difficult fight. In 
characteristic style, he simply explained that he is a parent--a parent 
who cares about the future his children will inherit and a parent that 
is dedicated to leaving his community a better place than he found it.
  I am proud to count Mr. Alevy amongst my friends. His spirited 
campaign to save our neighborhoods is a tribute to his concern for our 
future and his devotion to his community. Now that his efforts have 
been proven a success, it would have been inappropriate for this 
Congress to fail to recognize his immeasurable contribution.
