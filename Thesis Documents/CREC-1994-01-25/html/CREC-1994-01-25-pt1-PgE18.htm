             HONORING CUBA, NM'S, FUTURE SEARCH CONFERENCE

                                 ______


                          HON. BILL RICHARDSON

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I join the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Forest Service in proudly recognizing the joint effort of 
the Forest Service's Cuba, NM, Ranger District and the citizens of the 
Cuba area in their efforts to plan for the future.
  In an effort to develop a long-term economic development strategy for 
the Cuba area, the Cuba Ranger District of the Santa Fe National Forest 
assisted the Cuba area in applying for a $30,000 grant under the 
Economic Diversification Study Program.
  The result was the Future Search Conference which brought together 
over 80 stakeholders who together identified commonly held values, 
skills, and experiences. Focusing on the past, the present, and the 
future, stakeholder groups came up with both short- and long-term 
action plans to begin strategically implementing their ideal future. 
The major success of the Future Search Conference was the bringing 
together, for the first time, of a large group of diverse people to 
talk about and cooperatively plan for the future.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Cuba Ranger 
District and the many local citizens who played a critical role in this 
joint public-private enterprise. I hope communities in other States 
learn and benefit from this New Mexico experience.

                          ____________________
