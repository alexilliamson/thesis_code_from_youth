                    TRIBUTE TO DR. JOYCE A.M. THOMAS

                                 ______


                          HON. STENY H. HOYER

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
commemorate the retirement of a distinguished leader in the Prince 
Georges County public school system, Dr. Joyce A.M. Thomas. Her 
extraordinary career included many significant contributions to our 
community and her retirement will be a great loss for the students and 
parents of Prince Georges County.
  Dr. Thomas is a pioneer in the field of education. Her innovative 
perspectives and strategies are well known not only in the State of 
Maryland but also throughout the country. Dr. Thomas was the force 
behind the development and implementation of the nationally recognized 
Magnet Program. This program offered the students of Prince Georges 
County the opportunity to enhance their learning experiences, and 
pursue specific educational interests. Since the program's inception in 
1985 it has grown from two programs in 10 schools to 16 programs in 52 
schools.
  Dr. Thomas also initiated and coordinated the first full time Project 
Head Start Program for Prince Georges County and coordinated the Follow 
Through Program for the county. This project encouraged students to 
realize their full academic potential with pride and confidence.
  Dr. Joyce A.M. Thomas has dedicated her career to the educational 
advancement of the residents of Prince Georges County. Her tireless 
devotion and unremitting hard work have made a tremendous difference in 
the quality of many lives. For this, Mr. Speaker, we owe her a great 
debt of gratitude and our warmest wishes for great happiness in her 
future endeavors.
