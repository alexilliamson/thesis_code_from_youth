WELCOMING THE HONORABLE VERNON J. EHLERS OF MICHIGAN AS A MEMBER OF THE 
                                 HOUSE

  (Mr. DINGELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes the dean of the Michigan 
delegation, the Honorable John Dingell.
  Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, let me say to my colleagues that I have the 
privilege today and the great personal pleasure to introduce to this 
House its newest Member, who will serve with distinction and who has 
compiled already a remarkable record of public service, 9 years in the 
Senate of the State of Michigan, 2 years in the Michigan State House, 
and he has compiled a remarkable record with special concern over 
matters like environment and science. He will be a distinguished Member 
of this body, the Honorable Vern Ehlers.
  I would like at this time to yield to my good friend, the gentleman 
from Michigan, Mr. Upton.
  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank our Chairman for yielding. I would 
like to say before the House that this House loved two of its previous 
Members, Gerry Ford and Paul Henry. As Jim Ford, the Chaplain of the 
House, said earlier today, he asked us to pray for character and 
justice. Character and justice certainly reflect the words and the 
deeds of both Gerry Ford and Paul Henry, and I know that Vern Ehlers 
will fill those shoes, admirably so.
