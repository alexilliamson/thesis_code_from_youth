          SOUND AGREEMENT REACHED ON THE C-17 GLOBEMASTER III

                                 ______


                           HON. STEPHEN HORN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. HORN. Mr. Speaker, during the congressional recess, Secretary of 
Defense Les Aspin and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition John 
Deutch announced a settlement with the McDonnell Douglas Corp. on the 
production of the C-17 airlifter. The C-17--or the Globemaster III--is 
produced by McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach CA. Under the arrangement, 
up to 40 C-17 aircraft will be produced at the end of the 2 years. If 
performance of the plane proves itself, the Defense Department has the 
option of requesting more planes in the future. This settlement was 
reached after an extensive review by the Defense Department.
  C-17 aircraft continue to roll off the assembly line in Long Beach. 
To date, four planes have been delivered to the Air Force at Charleston 
Air Force Base, SC, where they are undergoing field tests, and 
performing splendidly. The C-17 has already set 21 world records.
  I am confident that Congress will find the settlement reached to be 
fair and realistic. Having visited with the fine people in Long Beach 
who produce this state-of-the-art airplane, I am also confident that 
the C-17 will prove to be the airplane it was designed to be--the core 
airlifter for the armed services well into the next century.
