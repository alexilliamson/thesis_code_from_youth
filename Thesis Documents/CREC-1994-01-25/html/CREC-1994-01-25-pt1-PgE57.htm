                       OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVANT

                                 ______


                         HON. SOLOMON P. ORTIZ

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding 
public servant, Bob Quigley, assistant regional administrator for 
region VI of the U.S. Small Business Administration in Dallas, TX.
  Bob is 1 of only 10 procurement officers for the Small Business 
Administration, his jurisdiction falling over Texas and the surrounding 
States. He directs the operations involving prime-contracting, set 
asides, and subcontracting with large prime contractors.
  Annually, he is responsible for ensuring that the SBA meets the goals 
which we here in Washington insist that they meet. As we all know, that 
is no small task.
  Bob and I have worked on many projects together, both in the Coastal 
Bend and in the Valley--and I am forever grateful to him for his help 
and his wisdom in guiding me and my staff through the murky waters of 
the SBA bureaucracy. I have appreciated his knowledge about matters 
relating to small business.
  Bob Quigley was most instrumental in directing contracts for the work 
associated with the construction of Naval Station Ingleside--Homeport--
in the Coastal Bend. In the Valley, I remember--and am grateful for--
Bob's work on the Border initiative, which helped settle the Border 
economy after the devaluation of the peso. His efforts helped to 
revitalize the Border area and got much needed money to the merchants 
there to keep the commerce flowing.
  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, this is a man who has served our country 
in our Government for a total of 30 years. I ask that you all join me 
today in commending a great American patriot, and a fabulous 
administrator for the Dallas SBA for 14 years, Mr. Bob Quigley.
