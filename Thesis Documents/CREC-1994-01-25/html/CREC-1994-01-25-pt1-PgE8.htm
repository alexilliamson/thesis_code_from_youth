     PAUL CROTTY SALUTED FOR TREMENDOUS SERVICE TO CITY OF NEW YORK

                                 ______


                        HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a New 
Yorker who has given so much to our great city.
  When Paul Crotty recently accepted the position of corporation 
counsel to the city of New York, he acted to continue his distinguished 
career of public service. Prior to assuming this position, Mr. Crotty 
had served as commissioner of housing preservation and development from 
1986 to 1988, as commissioner of finance from 1984 to 1986, and as 
commissioner of the office financial services before that. Mr. Crotty 
has also served as chair of the New York City Employers Retirement 
Corp. and the Housing New York Corp.
  Mr. Crotty has also had an impressive career in private practice with 
the law firm of Donovan Leisure Newton and Irvine. He graduated from 
the University of Notre Dame in 1962, and spent 2 years thereafter on 
active duty in the U.S. Navy. Mr. Crotty then attended Cornell Law 
School, from which he graduated with distinction in 1967 as well as 
being awarded the school's first Fraser Prize for his accomplishments.
  As commissioner of finance, Mr. Crotty was responsible for 
administering the city's taxes, including the real property tax system 
which assesses over 900,000 parcels of real property on an annual 
basis. In that capacity, Mr. Crotty also helped draft New York's income 
and expense legislation, and led the big ticket sales tax investigation 
of sellers of luxury goods who filed false sales tax reports.
  As commissioner of housing, Mr. Crotty was responsible for the 
creation and implementation of a 10 year, $4.2 billion housing program. 
Mr. Crotty developed innovative new mechanisms for the allocation of 
capital funds which created, rehabilitated or preserved over 250,000 
dwelling units in New York City. In recognition of these achievements, 
Mr. Crotty received the City Club of New York's Bard Award.
  I am also proud to count Paul and his wife, Jane, as my close 
personal friends. And as his past record showed, New York City is lucky 
to have Mr. Crotty's services once again as corporation counsel. That's 
why I hope all of my colleagues will join me in saluting him for his 
record of public service and wishing him the best in his new capacity.
