                          WORDS VERSUS ACTIONS

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House of 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, before we hear the President's State 
of the Union Address, we should remember the last one.
  Last year the President promised America a middle-class tax cut.
  He delivered the largest tax increase in America's history.
  Last year the President promised an end of welfare as we know it.
  He delivered an end to the discussion of welfare before we knew it.
  Last Year the President promised health care reform.
  What he delivered were condom commercials.
  If you compare this President's words and his actions, words won time 
and time and time again.
  Tonight the President will come here again. And again he will 
promise, this time about crime.
  But the test of his performance is not in his delivery tonight, but 
in his delivery tomorrow.
  If the last year was any indication, then America will be returning 
to President Clinton's rice cake approach to policy: you will find 
yourself full when he is finished, but hungry before you are home.
