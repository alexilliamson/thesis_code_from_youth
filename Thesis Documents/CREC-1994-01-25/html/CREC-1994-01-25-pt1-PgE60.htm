                         TRIBUTE TO SMOKEY BEAR

                                 ______


                           HON. GLENN POSHARD

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. POSHARD. Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to have the eastern half of 
the Shawnee National Forest in the 19th Congressional District which I 
am privileged to serve here in the U.S. House of Representatives. Each 
year, this forest provides thousands of visitors an opportunity to 
enjoy the awesome wonders of nature. The Shawnee National Forest 
provides a backdrop to countless family reunions, scout retreats, 
camping expeditions and fishing trips. I remember many occasions in 
which my family and I had the opportunity to enjoy the beauty and 
natural resources provided by the Shawnee National Forest.
  Unfortunately, the Shawnee National Forest has seen the devastation 
and destruction of fire caused not by nature's cycle, but by man's 
carelessness. Because of the growing number of fires caused by man, the 
Shawnee National Forest has had to call upon Smokey Bear, the Forest 
Service's spokesperson on forest fire prevention, to aid in educating 
Americans, young and old alike, about the importance in being 
responsible keepers of the forest.
  On August 9, 1994, Smokey Bear will celebrate his 50th year of 
bringing his message of forest fire prevention to millions of 
Americans. Created by artist Albert Staehle, Smokey was first 
introduced to America in a forest service poster as a bear clad in a 
hat and a pair of blue jeans asking people to extinguish their 
campfires when visiting our Nation's parks and forests. Over the next 
50 years, Smokey's image and message of ``Only you can prevent forest 
fires!'' has been seen and heard on radio, television and in thousands 
of classrooms and educational settings. Smokey has also received his 
own television series and film, was seen at the National Zoo and has 
appeared in hundreds of parades, including the Macy's Thanksgiving Day 
parade. Smokey has achieved such national recognition over the past 50 
years that he received his own zip code and stamp from the U.S. Postal 
Service. Recipient of the OBIE Award for Excellence for outdoor 
advertising, the Smokey Bear campaign remains the longest running 
public service advertising campaign in the history of The Advertising 
Council.
  The Forest Service estimates that human-caused wildfires have been 
reduced by approximately one-half since Smokey Bear was introduced in 
1944. This is despite the fact that more than 10 times as many people 
visit our national parks and forests today as in the 1940's. I have to 
admit, that is quite an accomplishment for a bear.
  So it is with great pride that I wish Smokey Bear a happy 50th 
birthday and the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service 
warm congratulations on a very successful educational campaign to 
preserve our Nation's forests. I invite my fellow colleagues and all of 
America to join with me in celebrating Smokey Bear's 50th birthday and 
50 years of successfully preserving the beauty and tranquility of our 
national parks and forests.
