                       THANKS TO HOFFMAN-LaROCHE

                                 ______


                        HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to take a few minutes to 
recognize Hoffman-LaRoche for their generous grant to the Parenting 
Preemies Program at Family Health Plan of Alviso of San Jose, CA.
  This grant, by allowing for the continuation of the innovative 
Parenting Preemies Program, will not only benefit those directly 
involved in the program, it will also serve to improve the health of 
the entire community.
  LaRoche's invaluable interest in the San Jose community is greatly 
appreciated. It is the involvement of businesses like Hoffman-LaRoche 
that allows organizations such as Parenting Preemies in San Jose to 
successfully try new ideas and programs that are meant to improve the 
lives of everyone in the community.
  Again, I'd like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Hoffman-LaRoche for 
their generosity and impressive civic mindedness.

                          ____________________
