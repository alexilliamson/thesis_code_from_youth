                      TRIBUTE TO RONALD A. NERVITT

                                 ______


                          HON. STENY H. HOYER

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the prominent career of 
Assistant Commissioner Ronald A. Nervitt who will retire this month 
from his position as Chief Executive of Information Resources, 
Financial Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. 
Mr. Nervitt has held this position since October, 1984, and his 
departure will be a great loss to his colleagues and the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury.
  Mr. Nervitt's career in the U.S. Government began more than 35 years 
ago. His extensive career includes service in the National Security 
Agency, the General Services Administration, and the Naval Intelligence 
Processing System Support Activity. Under his guidance and leadership, 
Mr. Nervitt successfully directed major programs in telecommunications, 
computer systems design and implementation, computer security, high 
speed digital transmissions, and bulk encryption. Among his most 
notable accomplishments, Mr. Nervitt was responsible for implementing 
the first digital transmission systems in Defense networks in the 
seventies and led the efforts to implement the first secure voice 
systems for telephones in the eighties.
  As the Chief Executive of Information Resources, Financial Management 
Service at the Department of the Treasury, he developed and implemented 
the first ``electronic signature'' system for certifying payments, 
converted the computer system to produce paper checks, and directed the 
implementation of a new check payment and reconciliation system.
  Mr. Nervitt's strong sense of civic responsibility and professional 
successes have been recognized throughout his outstanding career. In 
1975 he was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award, he received 
Secretary Brady's Citizenship Award in 1992 and a meritorious 
Presidential Rank Award in 1993.
  Mr. Speaker, Assistant Commissioner Ronald A. Nervitt's distinguished 
career and service to the citizens of the United States is 
characterized by his keen insight, and the execution of progressive 
policies. Because of his innovative pursuits many Government agencies 
are now operating more efficiently and with a greater sense of 
security. We are very fortunate to have had such a committed man serve 
in the U.S. Government.
