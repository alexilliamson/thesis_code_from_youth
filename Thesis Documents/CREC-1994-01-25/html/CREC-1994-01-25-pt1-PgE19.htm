                      GIVE WELFARE REFORM A FORUM

                                 ______


                           HON. BILL EMERSON

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, one of candidate Clinton's most popular 
campaign promises was, ``to end welfare as we know it.'' In tonight's 
State of the Union Address, President Clinton is expected to offer the 
administration's support for welfare reform along with his welfare 
reform policy guidelines. Whatever initiatives the President chooses to 
pursue with regard to welfare reform, the legislation will need a 
forum.
  Today, I am introducing with my good friend from Delaware, Mike 
Castle, a bill which will give Congress a new way of doing business. 
Our legislation will create a welfare ad hoc committee to facilitate 
and expedite the development and passage of comprehensive welfare 
reform legislation.
  In June, the Welfare Simplification and Coordination Advisory 
Committee released a timely report on our Nation's public assistance 
programs. I believe this study, authorized by my amendment to the 1990 
farm bill, lays the foundation for substantive welfare reform.
  The prevailing opinion of the distinguished members of the Welfare 
Simplification and Coordination Advisory Committee is that,

       The conglomeration of separate programs that supposedly 
     comprise our ``welfare system'' do not form a system at all. 
     Instead, each operates in its own separate orbit, assisting a 
     specific population, without regard to the multiple needs of 
     the families it serves.

  The fragmented public assistance system is exacerbated by the 
committee system in Congress. Right now, a comprehensive welfare reform 
bill would be referred to at least four House committees and five 
subcommittees. While multiple jurisdictions can offer different 
perspectives and new ideas to an issue, in the welfare arena, the 
jurisdictional overlap has not generated a comprehensive, coordinated, 
and simplified welfare system.
  During the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress' hearings, 
I heard a great deal of testimony regarding committee realignment 
urging changes. These suggestions ran the gamut, from minor tinkering 
to fundamental committee realignment. Several congressional scholars 
suggested--as an option--that Congress make use of its authority to 
create temporary ad hoc committees in order to respond to issues in a 
timely manner. Our bill would do just that.
  Now is the time for the Congress to change the way it does business. 
Welfare recipients need welfare reform. The taxpayer deserves welfare 
reform. The welfare ad hoc committee will provide a forum for 
comprehensive welfare reform.
