        TRIBUTE TO CHIEF M.SGT. ALDEN R. HARGETT, U.S. AIR FORCE

                                 ______


                          HON. EVA M. CLAYTON

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of his retirement from the 
U.S. Air Force, I wish to recognize Chief M. Sgt. Alden R. Hargett for 
his 30 years of dedicated service to our country. In his most recent 
assignment as chief of the Information Management Branch, Inquiry 
Division, Office of Legislative Liaison, Chief Hargett provided an 
invaluable service to every member of Congress. Having demonstrated 
superior leadership, initiative, and strong management abilities, he 
was personally selected to manage the overall operation of the 
Information Management Branch which processes all Presidential, Vice 
Presidential, and congressional correspondence for the Secretary of the 
Air Force and the Air Force Chief of Staff. There he managed the 
accountability of all inquiries referred to the Department of the Air 
Force as well as serving as the Freedom of Information Act manager for 
the Air Force Office of Legislative Liaison.
  Best-in-the-business credentials and his widely recognized 
credibility within the information management community mandated his 
selection to serve on several headquarters level quality management 
teams as the information management representative. He personally 
conducted the requirements definition and source selection studies 
resulting in the installation of a state-of-the-art document imaging 
system for legislation liaison. So thorough was this effort, it became 
the example for other agencies to follow as they undertook 
modernization of their information management functions. His 
contributions during this tour will have a positive impact on 
legislative liaison long after his departure.
  Born in Cove City, NC, Chief Hargett graduated from Newbold High 
School in 1961. He has an applied science degree from the Community 
College of the Air Force and has continued to pursue his baccalaureate 
degree through Central Texas College, the College of the Air Force, 
Wayne Community College, and the Eastern Washington State University. 
He is currently attending the University of Maryland.
  Chief Hargett entered the Air Force from the U.S. Army Active 
Reserves in March 1966. Significant assignments have included tours in 
France, Korea, and Alaska. Assignments also have been in North 
Carolina, Texas, and the DC area, including three Pentagon tours. The 
chief is married to the former Dorothy L. Dawson of Vanceboro, NC. They 
have two daughters, Deborah, an attorney, and Regina, a captain in the 
Air Force.
  I want to join his fellow service members in commending Chief Hargett 
on an exemplary service career and wish him every success in civilian 
life.
