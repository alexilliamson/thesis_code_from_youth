                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE

  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, under a previous order, there was to be 
at this time a vote on a motion to instruct. I now ask unanimous 
consent that I and then the Republican leader be recognized for the 
purpose of making brief opening statements and that upon the completion 
of the Republican leader's remarks, the Senate proceed to vote on the 
motion to instruct.
  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, will the 
majority leader tell me how long that will last?
  Mr. MITCHELL. I anticipate our remarks in total should be no more 
than 15 minutes or so.
  I apologize for any inconvenience to Senators by virtue of this 
change. It is to accommodate other Senators.
  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?
  Hearing no objection, the request is granted. The majority leader is 
recognized.
