   IDAHO WILDERNESS, SUSTAINABLE FORESTS AND COMMUNITIES ACT OF 1994

                                 ______


                           HON. LARRY LaROCCO

                                of idaho

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. LaROCCO. Mr. Speaker, on March 31, 1993, I introduced the ``Idaho 
Wilderness, Sustainable Forests and Communities Act of 1993'' (H.R. 
1570). Since then, I have held two congressional field hearings in 
Lewiston and Boise in my District. My staff and I have held innumerable 
discussions with State and local officials; with representatives from 
the timber industry; with working men and women; with conservationists; 
and with recreationists. We have heard from literally thousands of 
Idahoans from all backgrounds who have a common interest in resolving 
the issue of Idaho's roadless areas.
  As a result, I have revised my legislation to reflect an emerging 
consensus of Idahoans. This bill will result in the release of two 
thirds of the roadless areas--260,000 additional acres--to the Forest 
Plans which, in turn, will result in certainty and stability for our 
communities and sustainability for our forests. In short, it is a jobs 
bill.
  The bill reflects my agreement with Governor Andrus on Meadow Creek 
and to protect Idaho's water. It strengthens the original language on 
private property rights. And, it makes revisions in each of the five 
national forests in the first district.


                              water rights

  Upon introduction of my original bill, I promised I would address the 
issue of water rights during the legislative process. With the advice 
and agreement of Governor Andrus, the language would prohibit the 
assertion of any claim, based on this Act or any other Act, for any 
U.S. water right for areas designated as wilderness or special 
management area in my bill. It would also prohibit the use of eminent 
domain--condemnation--for acquiring either water or water rights within 
areas designated in my bill.
  In addition, several ongoing efforts continue to hold promise to 
address this contentious issue including compromise language recently 
enacted for wilderness in Colorado as well as the Snake River 
adjudication process.
  The bill attempts to exclude any water facilities, such as 
impoundments, ditches, and pipelines, from the wilderness boundaries 
proposed in my bill. If, through oversight any such facility is 
included, I will work to make sure that continued access to these 
facilities is permitted.


                        private property rights

  The bill expands the original language to protect private property 
rights beyond any previous wilderness legislation enacted into law. 
This bill would establish a process whereby an owner of property 
adjacent to wilderness established under this bill could file a claim 
for compensation for any reduction in property value. Of course, it is 
often true that private property adjacent to wilderness increases in 
value.
  In addition, this bill retains language from my original bill to 
prohibit the creation of buffer zones around a wilderness to the 
detriment of any adjacent private property.


                    idaho panhandle national forests

  My bill strengthens the timber management language for the special 
management areas in Boundary County in recognition of the recent 
cutbacks in Federal timber sales and the recovery actions for species 
listed or proposed to be listed under the Endangered Species Act. It 
also provides for an economic analysis to assess the impacts of 
recovery actions for endangered species.
  My bill provides for intensive forest management demonstration 
projects to gather information on increasing wood fiber production 
through advanced silvicultural practices on areas within Boundary 
County and portions of the St. Joe National Forest.


                       clearwater national forest

  My bill removes some 20,000 acres within the timber base from the 
proposed Great Burn and Lewis and Clark Wilderness. Specifically, it 
withdraws Fish Lake and the Fish Lake Trail from the Great Burn area.
  The bill proposes an additional 7,000 acres to be added to the Selway 
Bitterroot Wilderness. These are lands located in White Sand and Beaver 
Creeks on the Powell Ranger District.
  The bill removes some 123,000 acres of special management areas in 
East Weitas Creek and the Vanderbilt Hill area.
  The bill includes language to assure that, upon enactment, the 
boundaries established will take precedence over the boundaries set in 
the September 1993 Clearwater Agreement. To forestall any delay in 
revising the Clearwater Forest plan, I have directed the Forest Service 
to report to Congress if the plan is not revised by December 31, 1996.


                       nez perce national forest

  With the agreement of Governor Andrus, the bill removes the west side 
of Meadow Creek from the Meadow Creek additions to the Selway 
Bitterroot Wilderness, a reduction of some 58,000 acres.
  Management decisions on West Meadow Creek would be based on the 
watershed protection projects provided in the legislation.
  An additional 1,000 acres was designated as wilderness in the Selway 
Bitterroot Wilderness at the head of Bear Creek on the Montana State 
line.
  The Nez Perce portion of Rapid River was designated a special 
management area with the same prescription shown for the area on the 
Payette National Forest. This was an oversight and was intended to be 
included in H.R. 1570.


                        payette national forest

  The bill removes the addition to the Frank Church River Of No Return 
Wilderness.
  It extends the Patrick Butte Wilderness proposal to the north to the 
Payette National Forest boundary adding 6,000 acres.
  The French Creek Wilderness proposal was extended north to include 
the French Creek break lands adding some 5,000 acres. The French Creek 
Special Management Area included in H.R. 1570 has been removed.
  The four-wheel drive trail along the South Fork of the Salmon River 
bisecting the Secesh proposed wilderness was removed from wilderness as 
well as the adjacent private property.


                         boise national forest

  The Johnson Creek Special Management Area was removed.
  In addition to snowmobiles, the Snowbank Special Management Area will 
now allow the use of off-road vehicles for administrative purposes.
