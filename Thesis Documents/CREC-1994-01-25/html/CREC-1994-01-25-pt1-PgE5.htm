  ERIN WHITTEN OF GLENS FALLS, NEW YORK HONORED FOR ``FIRSTS'' IN PRO 
                                 HOCKEY

                                 ______


                        HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, you have to be pretty tough to compete in 
the rough-and-tumble world of professional hockey. If you also happen 
to be a woman, you also have to be especially talented.
  That's why I and everybody else from my hometown of Glens Falls, NY, 
and the surrounding area are especially proud of goalie Erin Whitten, 
the first American-born woman ever to play the sport on the 
professional level.
  In fact, she is good enough to make everyone in the world of hockey 
forget her gender and appreciate the abilities she first displayed in 
the Adirondack Youth Hockey Association when she was seven years old.
  With Erin in the net, the Glens Falls High School's boys' hockey team 
compiled a record of 21-9-2, thanks to Erin blocking 84.6 percent of 
the shots against here. She was the first woman to participate in the 
division 2 high school state championships, and received an 1988-89 
all-conference honorable mention.
  At the University of New Hampshire, Erin was a four-time ECAC Goalie 
of the Year, the University's 1992-93 Women's Athlete of the Year, a 
two-time ECAC player of the week, and two-time Concordia University 
tourney player of the game. Her women's hockey record of 46 saves in 
one game still stands. Her 4-year save percentage at the University of 
New Hampshire was 91 percent, and the women's hockey team posted a 
record of 54-14-4. Erin was recognized by the New England Sportswriters 
Association.
  After college, Erin starred with the 1992 U.S. Women's National Team, 
the 18 to 22 year old select U.S. Women's Team at the North American 
Challenge at Lake Placid, and the 1993 U.S. Olympic Sports Festival in 
San Antonio, TX.
  After a brief stint with her hometown team, the Adironack Red Wings 
of the American Hockey League, Erin was signed by the Toledo Storm of 
the East Coast Hockey League. Last October 30th, Erin became the first 
women goalie to post a win in a regular season professional hockey 
game, when Toledo Storm beat Dayton.
  Currently, Erin is with the Dallas Freeze of the Central Hockey 
League, where we can expect her to continue compiling a number of 
firsts.
  And so you can see why her parents, Peter and Joan Whitten of Glens 
Falls, are so proud of her. I am, too.
  On February 3, the Women's Sports Foundation will celebrate the 
eighth annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day. Erin will be 
honored, along with several other women of comparable achievement in 
sports.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask all members of this House to join me for our own 
tribute to an outstanding athlete, Erin Whitten of Glens Falls, NY.
