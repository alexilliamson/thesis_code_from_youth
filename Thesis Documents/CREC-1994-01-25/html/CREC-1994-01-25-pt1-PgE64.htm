              PENSION LIABILITY FUNDING REFORM ACT OF 1994

                                 ______


                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the District of Columbia 
Pension Liability Funding Reform Act of 1994 as my first bill for the 
second session of the 103d Congress. It is my first bill because it is 
of first importance to the solvency of the District of Columbia. And it 
is my first bill because it would at least partially correct 
indefensible economic unfairness that has been imposed by Congress on 
the District. I am pleased to be joined in sponsoring this legislation 
by Congressmen Ronald Dellums, William Jefferson, John Lewis, and Jim 
McDermott--all distinguished members of the House District Committee.
  The Congress instituted benefit pension plans for the District's 
police officers and fire fighters in 1916, for teachers in 1920, and 
for judges in 1970. In 1979, Congress passed the District of Columbia 
Retirement Reform Act and transferred $2.0 billion in unfunded pension 
liability from the Federal Government to the residents of the District 
of Columbia. The pension benefits required by the Federal Government 
were provided on a pay-as-you-go basis, with payments each year 
covering only that year's benefit payments. Since fiscal year 1980, the 
$2.0 billion unfunded liability has increased to $5.0 billion. Only $79 
million of this increase went to benefits paid directly to pensioners. 
Of the $5.0 billion in unfunded liability, $3.7 billion or 75 percent 
has been for interest on the unfunded federally imposed amount. This 
amazing case study in fiscal irresponsibility is one of those rare 
instances in United States history when the rich Federal Government has 
off-loaded indebtedness to an American city.
  The unfunded indebtedness has now moved from an unfair burden to a 
crippling threat to the economic viability of the District of Columbia. 
The District, still struggling for air from a recession that has 
smothered its economy, is opposed by unfunded pension liability created 
and passed on by the Congress. Whoever is responsible, however, all 
must now take responsibility. The legislation I am introducing today 
will accomplish this urgent purpose.
  This bill would enact a plan that is the result of many months of 
intensive work by all--representatives from the affected employee 
groups, retirees, the Council, the Mayor's office, the General 
Accounting Office, the District of Columbia Retirement Board and the 
District Committee of the Congress. All labored together, month after 
month, hashed out the tough issues, and all have accepted financial 
responsibility.
  My bill essentially tracks the landmark 1990 report prepared by the 
Rivlin Commission (Alice Rivlin, a distinguished economist is now 
Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and was the 
first Director of the Congressional Budget Office), an objective 
outside blue ribbon commission. Under the bill, retirees would receive 
one cost of living adjustment per year rather than two, and the rate of 
contributions from employees would increase from 7 percent to 8 
percent. The District would increase its contribution as a constant 
percent of payroll at a 5 percent annual rate as currently estimated by 
the actuary. Finally, the Congress would extend its contribution period 
for 31 years, from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2035, and would 
increase its current flat contribution of $52.1 million per year at 5 
percent for 30 years starting in fiscal year 1996. These are painful 
prescriptions, especially for the retirees and employees.
  It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of this legislation 
to the fiscal health and stability of the District. By the year 2004, 
pension and interest payments will almost double to 15 percent of the 
District's operating budget. The closer we get to the year 2004, when 
the formula for computing the District's portion of the payment changes 
and the small Congressional contribution both expire, the greater the 
danger of irreparable harm to the city, to pensioners, and to city 
employees.
  The current District of Columbia Retirement Act provides for Federal 
and District contributions to the retirement funds through 2004. These 
are pay-as-you-go contributions that do not keep the unfunded liability 
from increasing. Moreover, the Act's funding provisions do not even 
attempt to eliminate unfunded liability, but allow interest to accrue 
at an exponential rate.
  Under the act, the formula for determining District contributions 
requires the Federal Government to contribute $52.1 million and the 
District to fund the rest. Today the District is paying more than $300 
million out of its annual operating budget to meet this obligation, 
more than five times the Federal contribution, consisting almost 
entirely interest on the original Federal unfunded liability.
  However, in 2005, the current legislation expires and the District's 
contribution will then rise to about 15 percent of the revenue 
collected by the District compared to 8 percent in 1991. By 2005, the 
     unfunded liability will reach $7.7 billion and without new 
     legislation all of the liability would fall to the 
     District.
  What is at stake in the bill I submit today is essentially 
everything--the stability of the city's operating budget for years to 
come and the pensions of the affected retirees and current employees. 
Considering the risk, what is astonishing is that this dangerous 
situation has prevailed for so long.
  My bill has the strong support of Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly and 
District of Columbia chair David Clark. In fact, Chairman Clarke has 
already introduced the Full Funding of Pension Liability Retirement 
Reform Amendment Act of 1994, in the city council. I am attaching a 
copy of the Clarke bill to this statement. His bill, submitted on 
December 21, 1993, would obligate the District and its employees and 
retirees to assume responsibility for by far the largest portion of the 
unfunded pension liability. Chairman Clarke is acting to expedite 
council consideration. He has placed his bill at the top of his agenda 
as I have placed this bill at the top of mine. Indeed, the council's 
hearings begin today.
  Because of the extraordinary importance of this bill, I am taking the 
unusual step of introducing the legislation before the council has 
passed the Clarke legislation. Although the two bills are directed at 
different legislatures, there are home rule implications, and 
ordinarily I would await council passage. However, the council 
legislation is sponsored by 12 of the 13 members, and mark up in 
council is expected on February 15. Therefore, I can introduce my bill 
today without fear of transgressing home rule and thereby also expedite 
congressional action.
  I ask my colleagues to take the responsible action contingent only on 
the willingness of the District government and the effected residents 
and employees to assume the sacrifices required of them in my bill and 
in the council legislation. This is not a problem of their making. It 
originated here. It must end with corrective action here.

                                H.R. --

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,
