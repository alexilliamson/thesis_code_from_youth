                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT C. GOLDEN

                                 ______


                          HON. SUSAN MOLINARI

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Ms. MOLINARI. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, January 25, 1994, a special 
event will take place in my district. The Cathedral Club of Brooklyn, 
NY, will gather to honor Robert C. Golden for his commitment to 
voluntary service. It is my pleasure to have this opportunity to thank 
him for his tireless efforts on behalf of the entire Brooklyn 
community.
  Mr. Golden was born on July 12, 1946. He grew up and was educated in 
New York, ultimately earning a MBA in finance from Fordham University. 
An active professional as well as an active volunteer, he presently 
works for Prudential Securities, Inc. as an executive vice president 
and director of operations.
  Mr. Golden is involved in numerous activities and has received many 
awards and honors for his endeavors. Please allow me to describe just a 
few.
  He is currently active in the Cathedral Club of Brooklyn and was its 
president from 1981 until 1982. The club raises funds to support the 
diocese of Brooklyn and its efforts in helping the needy.
  He was also a past president of the Bayfort Benevolent Association. 
This group of local community residents works to raise money for needy 
people during the holiday season. In addition to packing food baskets 
for hungry families, they also raise money to help purchase toys for 
children at Christmas or help needy families with the payment of bills. 
Families without heat or electricity during the winter have always been 
major concerns of the Bayfort Benevolent Association. As a result, some 
of the funds raised have also gone to remedy this situation.
  As a member of the board of governors and chairman of development for 
Heartshare Human Services of New York, Mr. Golden has raised over $1 
million for the agency to further its mission of aiding and 
facilitating adoptions and foster care placements.
  His wife Maureen, his daughter Kathleen, and his son Robert have 
undoubtedly been an inspiration to him.
  Mr. Speaker, many of the problems we face today could be solved if 
more individuals like Robert Golden would get involved. For this 
reason, I am happy for the occasion to show my appreciation to one such 
person. I applaud Robert C. Golden on his selfless years of service and 
thank him for his dedication to bettering lives in Brooklyn.
