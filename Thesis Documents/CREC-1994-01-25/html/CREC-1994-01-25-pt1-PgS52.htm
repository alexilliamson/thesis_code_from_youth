                   150TH ANNIVERSARY OF B'NAI B'RITH

<bullet> Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on October 13, 1843, a small group 
of immigrants in New York City founded B'nai B'rith, the first 
international service organization founded in the United States. At 
that time, a few people of the Jewish faith dreamed of uniting Jews in 
work that would promote not only their interests, but the interests of 
all humankind.
  Today, a half million members and affiliates in 52 countries carry on 
this dream. In October of 1843, 12 members contributed $60 each to a 
fund for widows and orphans. This year, B'nai B'rith will spend more 
than $25 million on education, social service, youth activities, and 
many other community programs and activities.
  B'nai B'rith fought anti-Semitism as early as 1851 when it persuaded 
the U.S. Senate, which was considering a pending treaty with 
Switzerland, to insist on the removal of anti-Jewish restrictions in 
several Swiss cantons. In 1913 it formally established the Anti-
Defamation League to coordinate the fight against anti-Semitism. Today, 
ADL is one of the world's foremost advocates of human rights, fighting 
for Jews and non-Jews alike.
  B'nai B'rith organized the National Jewish Hospital in Denver, a non-
sectarian, non-fee hospital which was a pioneer institution for 
treatment and research in tuberculosis.
  During the Civil War, members of a B'nai B'rith lodge in Chicago 
recruited and equipped a company of Jewish soldiers in response to 
President Lincoln's call for volunteers.
  Thirteen years before the founding of the American Red Cross, B'nai 
B'rith organized the first disaster relief campaign in the United 
States for victims of a Baltimore flood. This kind of work continues to 
this day.
  B'nai B'rith challenged the forced evacuation of Japanese-Americans 
from the west coast during World War II. At the same time, it sold 
millions of dollars worth of U.S. war bonds, contributed recreational 
facilities at military camps and hospitals, entertained service 
personnel and distributed game books and magazines. It was the first 
civilian organization to receive citations from the Army and the Navy.
  This is just a short summary of achievement of this fine 
organization. B'nai B'rith continues to step up to the challenges of 
guiding our youth, helping our seniors and serving our country. I am 
proud to bring the achievements of B'nai B'rith to the attention of my 
colleagues and I wish its leaders and members another 150 productive 
years--and more.<bullet>
