                      TRIBUTE TO STEVEN ST. PIERRE

                                 ______


                             HON. JACK REED

                            of rhode island

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute a distinguished young 
man from Rhode Island who has attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the 
Boy Scouts of America. He is Steven St. Pierre of Troop 11, in 
Coventry, and he was honored last week for his noteworthy achievement.
  Not every young American who joins the Boy Scouts earns the 
prestigious Eagle Scout Award. In fact, only 2.5 percent of all Boy 
Scouts do. To earn the award, a Boy Scout must fulfill requirements in 
the areas of leadership, service, and outdoor skills, He must earn 21 
merit badges, 11 of which are required from areas such as citizenship 
in the community, citizenship in the Nation, citizenship in the world, 
safety, environmental science, and first aid.
  As he progresses through the Boy Scout ranks, a Scout must 
demonstrate participation in increasingly more responsible service 
projects. He must also demonstrate leadership skills by holding one or 
more specific youth leadership positions in his patrol and/or troop. 
Jim has distinguished himself in accordance with each of these 
creteria.
  For his Eagle Scout project, Steven completed a much needed 
landscaping project of the surrounding property of the Coventry Town 
Hall/Library complex. This extensive project included the leveling of 
unnecessary barriers and the spreading of truckloads of mulch to 
improve the look of the complex.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in saluting Eagle 
Scout Steve St. Pierre. In turn, we must duly recognize the Boy Scouts 
of America for establishing the Eagle Scout Award and the strenuous 
criteria its aspirants must meet. This program has, through its 80 
years, honed and enhanced the leadership skills and commitment to 
public service of many outstanding Americans, two dozen of whom now 
serve in the House.
  It is my sincere belief that Steve St. Pierre will continue his 
public service and in so doing will further distinguish himself and 
consequently better his community. I am proud that Jim undertook his 
Scout activity in my representative district, and I join friends, 
colleagues, and family who salute him.

                          ____________________
