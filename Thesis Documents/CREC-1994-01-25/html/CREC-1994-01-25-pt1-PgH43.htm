                      FIGHTING FIRE WITH GASOLINE

  (Mr. BALLENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BALLENGER. Mr. Speaker, one of the principle reasons the 
President has said we need health care reform is because of its effects 
on the deficit.
  But the Clinton health plan will have an explosive effect on our 
deficit. According to a Joint Economic Committee study, the annual 
Federal deficit will increase by $426 billion per year by the year 
2000.
  This is like fighting fire with gasoline.
  Mr. Speaker, there are some problems with our health care system. But 
the Clinton Government-run health plan will not cure those problems.
  Hiring more bureaucrats, building more Government structures, 
creating more Government positions, will not improve our health care 
delivery system.
  And increasing our deficit by $426 billion a year will not solve our 
budget crisis.
  I urge my colleagues to think twice about the Clinton health care 
reform plan. Fighting fire with gasoline will never put out the fire.
