WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1994

No. 1


House of Representatives

  The House met at 12 o'clock noon.
  The SPEAKER. This being the day fixed by Public Law 103-207 of the 
103d Congress, enacted pursuant to the 20th amendment of the 
Constitution for the meeting of the 2d session of the 103d Congress, 
the House will be in order.
  The prayer will be offered by the Chaplain.
  The Chaplain, Rev. James David Ford, D.D., offered the following 
prayer:
  O gracious God, You are the creator of all that is and Your blessings 
abound with peace and understanding. On this special day we call upon 
You so Your favor is with us and Your benediction guides us. As we see 
the needs of the Nation, we pray for discernment and vision; when we 
seek to solve any abuse or wrong, we pray for wisdom and patience; when 
we seek to represent people and establish leadership for the common 
good, we pray for integrity and character; and when we contest for 
justice and equity, may we receive the strength to do those things that 
honor Your creation and serve people everywhere. This is our earnest 
prayer. Amen.
