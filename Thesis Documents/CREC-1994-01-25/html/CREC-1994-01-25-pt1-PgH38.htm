           SIXTY PERCENT APPROVE PRESIDENT CLINTON'S EFFORTS

  (Mr. RICHARDSON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, the reason for so much partisan 
bellyaching on the other side is simple: President Clinton's approval 
rating is a healthy 60 percent because the public believes he is trying 
to address the Nation's problems.
  And the reason why the perception of the Congress is at an all-time 
low is because the public thinks that all we do is fight and fail to 
get things done. And if we want to be re-elected, we won't need term 
limits if we continue this bickering.
  Do we go first on health care, or crime, or welfare reform? Who cares 
as long as we get the job done?
  We are ready to pass a significant crime bill soon with tough 
sentencing and prevention. Let us put that on a fast track and let us 
get a good start on welfare reform. But let us be realistic and 
recognize that a good health care plan should be our top goal this 
year.
  If we do our job right on health care reform, we will be rewarded at 
the polls.
