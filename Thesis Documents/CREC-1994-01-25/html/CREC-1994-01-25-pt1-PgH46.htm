          KICKING OFF THE SECOND SESSION OF THE 103D CONGRESS

  (Mr. BARCA of Wisconsin asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BARCA of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker and Members, today, as we kick 
off the second session of the 103d Congress, we all return after a 
fairly lengthy recess, and for me, after spending almost all the last 2 
months crisscrossing my district, talking with various groups and 
individual constituents, I believe that, while people have appreciated 
the flurry of activity that came about at the end of the last session 
and the many bills and important measures that did pass, they are 
calling for more comprehensive and swift action on a wide array of very 
important priorities for this Nation, from welfare reform to crime 
control measures, to health care reform, to economic development, to 
making further progress on deficit reduction, and it is my hope that we 
can keep and continue that bipartisan spirit that we ended the last 
session on, to move forward with adopting this agenda with that sense 
of urgency that is all across Wisconsin and, I believe, the rest of the 
byways of this Nation which has to be brought to the Halls of Congress.
  So, Mr. President, we welcome you tonight. We hope to have you kick 
off this very vitally important session, and hopefully we can work 
together to achieve the people's agenda.
