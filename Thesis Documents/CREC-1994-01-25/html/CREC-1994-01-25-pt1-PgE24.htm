  Mr. PARKER. Mr. Speaker, today I stand in the Halls of Congress, in 
the people's chamber, to speak in honor of an outstanding citizen from 
my district, Mr. John Wesley Morgan of Brookhaven, MS.
  J.W. Morgan has dedicated his entire life to the betterment of 
Brookhaven, which is not just his hometown, but the place he has called 
home his entire life. Born to the late Jim Morgan and Bertha Hooker 
Morgan, he is a graduate of Alexander High School, where he will be 
honored by his friends, his wife, Elouise Brown Morgan, and his 
colleagues, January 29, at the junior high auditorium.
  Mr. Morgan has given so much of himself to Lincoln County. He served 
as a member of the Brookhaven Housing Authority from December 1972 to 
May 1975. He served as president of the Alexander Junior High School 
PTA from 1978 to 1979 and was elected as alderman of ward one in 1977. 
He now is serving his fifth term as alderman and is mayor pro tempore 
of Brookhaven. Mr. Morgan is a member of the chamber of commerce, the 
NAACP, Mason Keystone Lodge No. 73, and the Kiwanis Breakfast Club. He 
serves on the board of directors of the United Givers Fund [UGF].
  Mr. Morgan was the first African-American in Mississippi to obtain a 
license as a radio announcer. He became a deejay in 1952 for WCHJ. He 
continues to host the ``Spiritual Time'' program on Sundays from 6 to 
10 a.m.
  He has been an employee of State Bank for more than 31 years, since 
beginning in August 1962 as a messenger. Mr. Morgan also has attended 
St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church his entire life, where he has served 
as Sunday school superintendent. In 1970, he was ordained as a deacon, 
and he currently is church treasurer.
  I salute Mr. J.W. Morgan for his community spirit and dedication to 
building a better Brookhaven. His example is one worth following. Mr. 
Morgan, congratulations and thank you.
