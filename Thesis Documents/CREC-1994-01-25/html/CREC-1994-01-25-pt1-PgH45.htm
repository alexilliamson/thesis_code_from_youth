                 STOP SWEEPING WHITEWATER UNDER THE RUG

  (Mr. ROTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTH. Mr. Speaker, as the Congress begins the new session it is 
disturbing to read in the front page of the newspaper that people's 
opinion of the Congress is at an all-time low. The savings and loan 
crisis is just one of the issues that has eroded public trust and 
confidence in Congress. That is only one of the compelling reasons for 
Congress to exercise its obligation to have congressional legislative 
oversight hearings, and that is why congressional leaders must stop 
sweeping the White-water scandal under the rug.
  Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and 
its oversight subcommittee must hold hearings on Whitewater. After all, 
Madison Guarantee Savings and Loan cost the American taxpayers over $50 
million. I have asked both the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs chairman and subcommittee oversight chairman to hold hearings, 
but to no avail. I ask them again to stop ignoring this problem, and to 
stop this coverup, and have Congress perform its obligations to the 
American people.
  Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs is 
AWOL. It is time to find a chairman and to hold hearings to let the 
American people truly know what happened in Whitewater.
