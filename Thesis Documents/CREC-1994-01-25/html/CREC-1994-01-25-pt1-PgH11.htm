     ANNOUNCEMENT OF RESIGNATION OF RON DE LUGO, MEMBER OF CONGRESS

  (Mr. de LUGO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. de LUGO. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, I told the people of the 
Virgin Islands that I would not be seeking any elective office in the 
coming election. I want to say goodbye to this House today, where I had 
the honor to serve as the first Delegate from the Virgin Islands ever 
in the history of our Republic.
  I came to this Capitol some 24 years ago. I was elected, as I am 
elected today, but I did not have a seat in the House. The Virgin 
Islands, the people of the Virgin Islands, did not have any 
representation in the House.
  I was a Washington Representative, and I served two terms in that 
position and was able, with the help of many of you who are here today, 
and particularly you, Mr. Speaker, and many of our friends who have 
gone, to get a seat for the people of the Virgin Islands.
  I have served some 20 years here. I have made wonderful friends on 
both sides of the aisle. I am a Democrat. I love the Democratic Party, 
but the truth is, as I have told the Members, some of my best friends 
are Republicans. They have been very helpful to me and to the people of 
the Islands.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you not only the Members but also the 
staff here in the House that helps us so much, and so many have shown 
me kindnesses.
  I leave this House after almost 40 years in elective office. I look 
forward to going home. I am sure when the Members think about it, and I 
am from the Virgin Islands, they will realize that it makes a lot of 
sense for me to want to go home. I thank the Members very much, and I 
thank you, Mr. Speaker.
