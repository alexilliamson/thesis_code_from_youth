       ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 1994 CONGRESS-BUNDESTAG STAFF EXCHANGE

<bullet> Mr. DeCONCINI. Since 1983, the U.S. Congress and the German 
parliament, the Bundestag, have conducted an annual exchange program in 
which staff members from both countries observe and learn about the 
workings of each other's political institutions and convey the views of 
members from both sides on issues of mutual concern.
  This exchange program has been one of several sponsored by both 
public and private institutions in the United States and Germany to 
foster better understanding of the institutions and policies of both 
countries.
  This year will mark the fourth exchange with a reunified Germany and 
a parliament consisting of members from both the West and the East. Ten 
staff members from the U.S. Congress will be chosen to visit Germany 
from April 23 to May 7. They will spend most of the time attending 
meetings conducted by members of the Bundestag, Bundestag party 
staffers, and representatives of political, business, academic, and 
media institutions. They also will spend a weekend in the district of a 
Bundestag member.
  A comparable delegation of German staff members will come to the 
United States in late June for a 3-week period. They will attend 
similar meetings here in Washington and will visit the districts of 
Members of Congress over the Fourth of July recess.
  The Congress-Bundestag exchange is highly regarded in Germany. 
Accordingly, U.S. participants should be experienced and accomplished 
Hill staffers so that they can contribute to the success of the 
exchange on both sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag sends senior 
staffers to the United States and a number of high-ranking members of 
the Bundestag take time to meet with the U.S. delegation. The United 
States endeavors to reciprocate.
  Applicants should have a demonstrable interest in events in Europe. 
Applicants need not be working in the field of foreign affairs, 
although such a background can be helpful. The composite United States 
delegation should exhibit a range of expertise in issues of mutual 
concern in Germany and the United States, such as, but not limited to, 
trade, security, the environment, immigration, economic development, 
health care, and other social policy issues.
  In addition, U.S. participants are expected to help plan and 
implement the program for the Bundestag staffers when they visit the 
United States. Among the contributions participants should expect to 
make is the planning of topical meetings in Washington. Moreover, 
participants are expected to host one or two staff people in their 
Member's district over the Fourth of July, or to arrange for such a 
visit to another Member's district.

  Participants will be selected by a committee composed of U.S. 
Information Agency personnel and past participants of the exchange.
  Senators and Representatives who would like a member of their staff 
to apply for participation in this year's program should direct them to 
submit a resume and cover letter only in which they state why they 
believe they are qualified, and some assurances of their ability to 
participate during the time stated. Applications may be sent to Bob 
Maynes or Ginger Harper, Office of Senator Dennis DeConcini, 328 Hart 
Building, by Tuesday, February 15.<bullet>
