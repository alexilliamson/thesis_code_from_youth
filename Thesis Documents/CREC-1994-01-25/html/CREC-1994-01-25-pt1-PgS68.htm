                           ORDER OF BUSINESS

  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, let me just say to colleagues that in a 
few moments we will be requesting by unanimous consent that there be a 
vote tomorrow morning, with the Senate coming in prior to that for 
morning business, and then there will be a recess period this evening 
between now and the time we assemble for the joint session of Congress 
for the State of the Union Message, and momentarily I will propound the 
appropriate unanimous-consent request. I believe Senator Helms will 
proceed tomorrow morning after the first vote, and I believe that the 
vote will be at approximately 10:30, by 10:30, and subsequently Senator 
Helms will proceed with two amendments that he has, both of which will 
require votes, and after that the bill will be open for further 
amendment.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________
