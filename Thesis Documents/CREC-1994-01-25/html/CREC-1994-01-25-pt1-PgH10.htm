                          INTENTION TO RETIRE

  (Mr. HUGHES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HUGHES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform my colleagues that 
yesterday, I announced that I have decided not to seek reelection, and 
that I intend to leave Congress at the end of this term.
  It was not an easy decision for me, because I love serving the people 
of south Jersey in this great institution. But, I will have completed 
30 years of public service at the end of this session--10 years in the 
prosecutor's office in Cape May County, and 20 years in the Congress.
  What is particularly gratifying is that I have been granted the 
singular honor of serving the people of the Second Congressional 
District of New Jersey in the House longer than any person in the 
history of the district. That says a lot about the special relationship 
between us.
  Before I entered politics, I served with many outstanding men and 
women over the years on a hospital board, drug abuse council, service 
clubs, church groups, and other organizations, but I have never served 
with a finer group of people than we have in the Congress of the United 
States.
  The overwhelming majority of Members are decent, honest, God-fearing 
citizens who work hard to make their districts and their country a 
better place to live. It is sad that this institution is too often 
judged by the few who have another agenda.
  My 19 years in the Congress have been more productive and satisfying 
than I ever could have imagined. I have enjoyed working with my 
colleagues in the House. I have been blessed with ranking Republicans 
on my subcommittees, beginning with Hal Sawyer and ending with Carlos 
Moorhead, who have enabled me to accomplish a great deal as a national 
legislator, particularly in the areas of law enforcement and 
intellectual property rights.
  I am so gratified by the fact that my law to ban the dumping of 
sewage sludge and chemical wastes in the ocean is considered by many as 
an environmental milestone.
  I am equally proud of my record of accomplishments back home. Indeed, 
you can't travel anywhere in my sprawling second district without 
finding my imprint on a project to create jobs, protect the 
environment, fix up the infrastructure, or improve the quality of life 
which we cherish so dearly in southern New Jersey.
  I will leave Congress with my head high, knowing that I have done my 
very best, and that I have made a difference. Although I am sad to 
leave elective public office, I am very excited at the prospect of 
taking on some new challenges. My wonderful wife Nancy and I are 
blessed with good health. We have four beautiful children and five 
grandchildren who I want to spend more time with.
  Indeed, I am looking forward to teaching my grandchildren how to 
fish, and how to bait their own hook so I can fish too.
  I will miss this institution and take a lot of wonderful memories 
with me at the end of this year. I think the late Donald Adams put it 
best when he said: ``To give real service, you must add something which 
cannot be bought or measured with money, and that is sincerity and 
integrity.''
  I hope that will be my lasting legacy. Thank you and God bless you 
all.
