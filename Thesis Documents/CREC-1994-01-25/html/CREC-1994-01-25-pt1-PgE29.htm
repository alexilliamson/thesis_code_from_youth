               TRIBUTE TO MOUNT CLEMENS GENERAL HOSPITAL

                                 ______


                          HON. DAVID E. BONIOR

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mount Clemens 
General Hospital. On January 13, Mount Clemens General celebrated 50 
years of service to the community.
  Founded in 1944 to provide obstetrical care to the citizens of Macomb 
County, this 288-bed osteopathic acute care facility has grown to offer 
many services to our community. As an educational hospital, Mount 
Clemens General provides quality medical training to physicians and 
staff. Mount Clemens General has an excellent emergency care center as 
well as a comprehensive cardiac care center. Rehabilitation, community 
education, pharmacy, and home health care services coupled with 
physician training clinics all demonstrate the hospital's commitment to 
providing quality health care in our community.
  Mount Clemens General has also provided Macomb County with several 
medical firsts. In addition to the Mat Gaberty Heart Institute, the 
Easy Street rehabilitation environment, begun in 1987, was the first of 
its type in the midwest. The dedication and professionalism have earned 
the hospital respect and recognition and I applaud those whose efforts 
have made Mount Clemens General a world class medical facility.
  On the occasion of the hospital's 50th anniversary, I am pleased to 
pay tribute to Mount Clemens General Hospital. I ask that my colleagues 
join me in saluting a valued service in my home community as they 
prepare for their next 50 years of service.
