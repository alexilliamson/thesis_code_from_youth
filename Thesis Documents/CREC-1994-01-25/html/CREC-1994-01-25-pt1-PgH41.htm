                JACKSONVILLE'S JAGUARS ARE ON THE PROWL

  (Mrs. FOWLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. FOWLER. Mr. Speaker, on November 30, 1993, Jacksonville, FL, was 
declared the final winner in the hotly contested race to become a 
National Football League expansion city. Due to the heroic efforts of 
``Touchdown Jacksonville,'' Wayne Weaver, Tom Petway, and the entire 
community, Jacksonville--against great odds--broke away from the 
competition and crossed the finish line victorious.
  In choosing our city, the NFL officially recognized northeast Florida 
as part of a vital and expanding area, with a promising future. They 
also recognized the appetite for football in the home of the Gatorbowl, 
and their faith was not misplaced. Jaguars ticket sales took off like a 
rocket, leading to sellout status within 40 days of the announcement--
with 70,000 tickets sold for each of the next 3 years.
  I am proud of our city, and I have no doubt that our new team will 
mirror the determination and enthusiasm of their fans. I am also 
confident that their opponents will soon learn what those of us in 
northeast Florida already know--the Jaguars are on the prowl.
