                   IN HONOR OF REED ADELBERT GALLIER

                                 ______


                        HON. MICHAEL J. KOPETSKI

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. KOPETSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to note the passing of an 
exemplary citizen from my home State of Oregon. in an age when some in 
this country are divisive and self-centered, it is truly a pleasure to 
recognize an individual whose life was centered on the principle of 
service to others--to his Nation, State, and community.
   Reed Adelbert Gallier was such a person. Born on July 5, 1922, and 
growing up in Bandon, he came to love the Oregon coast. After attending 
the Hill Military Academy in Portland, Reed attended the Evanston 
Collegiate Institute in Evanston, IL. He returned home to Oregon and 
attended Lewis and Clark College in Portland.
  The Second World War interrupted Reed's education. When Pearl Harbor 
was attacked, Reed answered his Nation's call. Putting service to his 
country above personal ambition. Reed enlisted in the U.S. Army and saw 
action as an infantryman in both Italy and North Africa.
  Following his honorable discharge from the military, Reed again 
attended Lewis and Clark College. Reed then reenlisted in the Army and 
completed a 20-year career. His service took him to both Korea and 
Japan. At one point in his military career, Reed served on the 
University of Oregon's military staff.
  Following Reed's military retirement, he went to work for the Oregon 
Department of Veterans' Affairs in 1965. As a veteran, Reed felt a 
special kinship with those he assisted. Filing a variety of positions 
within the Department, Reed served in central Oregon as well as on his 
beloved south coast. He retired from the agency in 1984, having 
completed his second 20 year career.
  Reed then focused his attention on community service, and served on 
the city of Bandon Planning Commission. Subsequently, he was appointed 
to the Bandon City Council. Serving for 10 years 4 as council 
president, Reed dealt with a variety of complex issues affecting the 
livability of his cherished community. In addition to his duties on the 
council. Reed was an active participant in civic organizations and his 
local church.
  In early 1992, Reed was appointed by Oregon's Governor to serve on 
the advisory committee to the director of the Oregon Department of 
Veterans' Affairs. Once again, Reed served with distinction in a 
demanding position. As a voice for veterans throughout Oregon, Reed 
played an active role in the effort to secure an Oregon State Veterans' 
home.
  Mr. Speaker, Reed Gallier is no longer with us, but his legacy of 
service endures. Let us honor his passing by rededicating ourselves to 
the principle of service to others. We owe him no less.
