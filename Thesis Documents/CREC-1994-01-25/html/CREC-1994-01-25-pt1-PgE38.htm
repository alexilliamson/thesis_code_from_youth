                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ``TEENY'' KRANZ

                                 ______


                        HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today 
to commend William ``Teeny'' Kranz for his extensive contributions to 
the First Congressional District of Indiana.
  Teeny is the 1993 recipient of the prestigious ``Sagamore of the 
Wabash'' award, conferred by Indiana Governor Evan Bayh. The ``Sagamore 
of the Wabash'' is the highest honor the Governor of Indiana can bestow 
on an Indiana resident, and it is a personal tribute given to those who 
have rendered a distinguished service to the State. The term 
``Sagamore'' was used by the American Indian Tribes of the Northeastern 
United States to describe a man of great wisdom to whom the chief would 
look for guidance and advice. Indicative of true leadership, the 
``Sagamore'' award is reserved for individuals who have made lifetime 
commitments to preserving the pride in Hoosier heritage among the 
citizens of Indiana.
  The youngest of 18 children, Teeny was born in a log cabin in 
Clinton, IN on July 14, 1912. He began his career with U.S. Steel's 
Gary Works in 1929, and he retired from Gary Works in 1976. For 16 of 
those 47 years, Teeny was president of the United Steelworkers of 
America, Local Union 1066. During his tenure as president, his union 
brethren came to depend upon him. Teeny represented those victimized by 
unfairness or misfortune, and employed every effort above and beyond 
the call of duty to assist them.
  A Navy veteran and a amateur boxer, Teeny's extraordinary career has 
not ended with his retirement. Teeny is currently the president of the 
Northwest Indiana Retiree's Club, which has recently grown into an 
association consisting of more than 500 members. A group organized by 
Teeny himself, members participate in social functions, fund-raisers, 
and community services.
  Teeny has earned the respect and admiration of generations of 
steelworkers, and through his determination and hard work, has become a 
leader not only among the United Steelworkers of America, but also 
throughout the entire Calumet region. I call upon my colleagues to join 
me in wishing Teeny a most rewarding retirement and continued success 
in his future endeavors.
