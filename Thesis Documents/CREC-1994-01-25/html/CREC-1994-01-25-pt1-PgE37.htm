                         HONORING TERRY LEEDOM

                                 ______


                          HON. BILL RICHARDSON

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, a powerful voice in my home State's 
largest city, Albuquerque, will be silenced at month's end. I am sorry 
to report that local talk show host Terry Leedom is being pulled off 
the air. It's not that KKOB-AM radio management is unhappy with 
Leedom's popular late night talk show. In fact, I'm told Terry is well 
liked. It seems the problem is economics--it is cheaper for the station 
to run a nationally syndicated talk radio show than pay Leedom a 
salary.
  Terry has done a great service in New Mexico by delving into 
controversial local issues--something nationally syndicated talk shows 
simply can't do. I viewed KKOB's airing of Terry's show more than just 
a commercial venture, but a real public service. With Terry's February 
1 departure, there will be a vacuum on Albuquerque's airwaves of public 
debate and discourse of local issues in Albuquerque.
  On behalf of Terry's many faithful listeners, it is my hope Terry 
will find a new home on Albuquerque airwaves soon so that we can once 
again debate, argue and disagree over local issues so important to the 
future of Albuquerque and New Mexico.
