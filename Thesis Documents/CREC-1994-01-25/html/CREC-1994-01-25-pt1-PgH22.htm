                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair desires to make an announcement. 
After consultation with the majority and minority leaders, and with 
their consent and approval, the Chair announces that tonight when the 
two Houses meet in joint session to hear an address by the President of 
the United States, only the doors immediately opposite the Speaker and 
those on his left and right will be open.
  No one will be allowed on the floor of the House who does not have 
the privilege of the floor of the House.
  Due to the large attendance which is anticipated, the Chair feels 
that the rule regarding the privilege of the floor must be strictly 
adhered to.
  Children of Members will not be permitted on the floor, and the 
cooperation of all Members is requested.
