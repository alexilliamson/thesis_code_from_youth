    LOREN SULLIVAN RETIRES AFTER YEARS OF SERVICE TO FORT EDWARD, NY

                                 ______


                        HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, to tell you the truth, if there were more 
Democrats like Loren Sullivan, I'd still be one.
  In all seriousness, I have no trouble in crossing party lines to pay 
tribute to an outstanding public servant who happens to be a Democrat. 
Such a man is Loren Sullivan, who retired January 1 as a member of the 
town council of Fort Edward, NY.
  His service to the community goes back to 1956, when he won a seat as 
a village trustee. He served on the village board for two terms and 
then took a short break from politics. He returned to run for a seat on 
the town board, and was elected to two 4-year terms. He stepped down 
again to devote more attention to his job in the cost accounting and 
payroll department of Sandy Hill Corp. But 10 years later he was raring 
to go again.
  He rejoined the town board in 1984, and when then-supervisor Daniel 
Hayes resigned, Loren Sullivan wound up serving 23 of Hayes' 24 months 
in office. He left office in 1987, the same year he retired after 40 
years at Sandy Hill.
  He returned for one more term on the town board in 1992.
  We can all envy Loren Sullivan for never losing any political race he 
ever entered.
  But that isn't all. He has found the time to coach fifth grade 
basketball and little league, and indicates he'll continue in that 
capacity. He is also looking forward to spending more time with his 
family.
  And I hope he has many years to do just that. Mr. Speaker, I ask you 
and all Members of this House, from both parties, to join me in tribute 
to one of the finest public servants I've ever known, Loren Sullivan of 
Fort Edward, NY.
