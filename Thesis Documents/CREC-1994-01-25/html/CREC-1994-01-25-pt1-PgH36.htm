                        WELCOME BACK, COLLEAGUES

  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome back all of our colleagues 
to Washington, DC, my hometown, and, for all practical purposes until 
the end of this session, yours.
  As you found when you went home, residence is not all we have in 
common; fear and spread of crime have eclipsed other issues with 9 out 
of 10 Americans feeling it is worse than it was a year ago.
  There is, thus, a clearer kinship across all party and district 
boundaries on this issue that has needlessly polarized us.
  The floor of the House has been a place to chastise this city as if 
crime were patented and put in a bottle labeled ``District of 
Columbia.''
  But, Mr. Speaker, the national crime genie has long been out of the 
bottle. Back home you discovered new magazine titles like ``Rural Crime 
Alert'' and new-found watch programs like Cities Neighborhood Watch 
groups. The crime menace has shown its brutal side well beyond this 
city's borders.
  Let our show of force be a balanced crime bill that catches crime 
both coming and going.
