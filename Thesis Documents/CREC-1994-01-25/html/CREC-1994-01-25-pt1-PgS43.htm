    TITLE III--UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING ACT OF 1994

     SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.

       This title may be cited as the ``United States 
     International Broadcasting Act of 1994''.

     SEC. 302. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.

       The Congress hereby finds and declares that--
       (1) it is the policy of the United States to promote the 
     right of opinion and expression, including the freedom ``to 
     seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any 
     media and regardless of frontiers,'' in accordance with 
     Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
       (2) open communication of information and ideas among the 
     peoples of the world contributes to international peace and 
     stability, and that the promotion of such communication is in 
     the interests of the United States;
       (3) prominent in the implementation of this policy has been 
     United States support for the Voice of America, Radio Free 
     Europe, Radio Liberty, and Broadcasting to Cuba, which have 
     demonstrated their effectiveness in providing accurate and 
     timely information to the people of the world;
       (4) the continuation of these broadcasting entities, and 
     the creation of a new broadcasting service to the people of 
     the People's Republic of China and the other communist 
     countries of Asia, would continue the promotion of 
     information and ideas, while advancing the goals of United 
     States foreign policy; and
       (5) the reorganization and consolidation of these services 
     will achieve important economies and strengthen the 
     capability of the United States to utilize these 
     instrumentalities to support freedom and democracy in a 
     rapidly changing international environment.

     established and operated within the funding limitations 
     provided for in section 307(d)(2).
       (4) The Comptroller General of the United States shall

       (2) Any grant agreement under this section shall require 
     that any contract entered into by RFE/RL, Incorporated, with

     States Government, and shall further specify that funds to 
     carry out the activities of RFE/RL, Incorporated, may not be 
     available after September 30, 1999.
       (3) Any such grant agreement shall require that any lease 
     agreements entered into by RFE/RL, Incorporated, with respect 
     to Radio Free Asia shall be, to the maximum extent possible, 
     assignable to the United States Government.
       (e) Limitations on Administrative and Managerial Costs.--
     (1) It is the sense of the Congress that administrative and 
     managerial costs for operation of Radio Free Asia should be 
     kept to a minimum and, to the maximum extent feasible, should 
     not exceed the costs that would have been incurred if Radio 
     Free Asia had been operated as a Federal entity rather than 
     as a grantee.
       (2) The Board shall include in the annual report required 
     by section 304(a)(7) information on the amount of funds 
     expended on administrative and managerial services by each of 
     the broadcasting services operated through the Bureau,

     unnecessary overhead costs for each of the broadcasting 
     services.

     provided to RFE/RL, Incorporated, for the purpose of 
     operating Radio Free Asia, the Board, through the Director of 
     the United States Information Agency, shall submit to the 
     appropriate congressional committees a report on--
       (1) whether Radio Free Asia is technically sound and cost-
     effective,
       (2) whether Radio Free Asia consistently meets the 
     standards for quality and objectivity established by law by 
     the United States Information Agency or the Board,
       (3) whether Radio Free Asia is received by a sufficient 
     audience to warrant its continuation,
       (4) the extent to which such broadcasting is already being 
     received by the target audience from other credible sources; 
     and
       (5) the extent to which the interest of the United States 
     is being served by maintaining broadcasting of Radio Free 
     Asia.
       (g) Sunset Provision.--The Board may not make any grant for 
     the purpose of operating Radio Free Asia after September 30, 
     1998, unless the President of the United States determines in 
     his fiscal year 1999 budget submission that continuation of 
     funding for Radio Free Asia for 1 additional year is in the 
     interest of the United States.
       (h) Notification and Consultation Regarding Displacement of 
     Voice of America Broadcasting.--The Board shall notify the 
     appropriate congressional committees before entering into any 
     agreements for the utilization of Voice of America 
     transmitters, equipment, or other resources that will 
     significantly reduce the broadcasting activities of the Voice 
     of America in Asia or any other region in order to 
     accommodate the broadcasting activities of Radio Free Asia. 
     The Chairman of the Board shall consult with such committees 
     on the impact of any such reduction in Voice of America 
     broadcasting activities.
       (i) Principal Place of Business.--Grants may only be made 
     to RFE/RL, Incorporated, if the principal place of business 
     of Radio Free Asia is within the Washington, D.C., 
     metropolitan area, unless the Board determines that another 
     location within the United States is necessary to carry out 
     the functions of Radio Free Asia effectively and in a cost-
     effective manner.

     SEC. 309. RADIO FREE EUROPE AND RADIO LIBERTY.

       (a) Authority.--Grants authorized under section 307(a) 
     shall be available to make annual grants for the purpose of 
     carrying out the same functions as were carried out by RFE/
     RL, Incorporated, before the date of enactment of this Act 
     with respect to Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, 
     consistent with section 2 of the Board for International 
     Broadcasting Act of 1973, as in effect on such date.

     pursuant to a grant agreement between the Board and RFE/RL, 
     Incorporated, which requires that grant funds shall only be 
     used for activities which the Board determines are consistent 
     with the purposes of subsection (a) and that RFE/RL, 
     Incorporated, shall otherwise comply with the requirements of 
     this section. Failure to comply with such requirements shall 
     permit the grant to be terminated without fiscal obligation 
     to the United States.
       (2) The grant agreement shall impose such conditions as the 
     Board determines may be appropriate pursuant to section 
     304(a)(3) to reduce overlapping language services and 
     broadcasting service with other broadcasting services 
     operated within the International Broadcasting Bureau.
       (3) The grant agreement shall require RFE/RL, Incorporated, 
     to justify in detail each proposed expenditure of grant 
     funds, and such funds may not be used for any other purpose 
     unless the Board gives its prior written approval.
       (c) Prohibited Uses of Grant Funds.--No grant funds 
     provided under this section may be used--
       (1) to pay any salary or other compensation, or enter into 
     any contract providing for the payment thereof in excess of 
     the rates established for comparable positions under title 5 
     of the United States Code or the foreign relations laws of 
     the United States, except that no employee may be paid a 
     salary or other compensation in an amount in excess of the 
     rate of pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule 
     under section 5315 of title 5, United States Code and that 
     the salary or other compensation limitations provided for in
