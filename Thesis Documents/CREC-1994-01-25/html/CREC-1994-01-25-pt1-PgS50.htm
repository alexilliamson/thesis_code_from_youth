                            MARTHA GRIFFITHS

<bullet> Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 30 years ago, the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 became law. Most of us in this body remember the events that 
led to the passage of that landmark legislation, and some of us may 
remember the debate that preceded its passage. But there was a very 
specific part of that debate that has special significance today.
  On February 8, 1964, former Congresswoman Martha Griffiths, of 
Michigan, gave an eloquent speech on the floor of the House of 
Representatives, urging her colleagues to add gender to the Civil 
Rights Act. She pointed out that the act would right some of the wrongs 
based on race, but she vehemently argued that wrongs based on gender 
were not addressed. Consequently, protection for women was included in 
the act.
  Martha Griffiths never abandoned her mission to promote the equality 
of women in our society, and later she successfully led the campaign 
for the equal rights amendment in the House.
  After completing 20 productive and notable years in Washington, 
Martha Griffiths retired from Congress and a few years later started a 
new career as Lieutenant Governor of Michigan, where she served 8 
years. And just recently, she was inducted into the National Women's 
Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, NY, only the 82nd woman to achieve this 
honor.
  On February 6, the American Association of University Women, along 
with the Michigan Women's Commission and the Michigan Women's 
Historical Center/Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, is honoring Martha 
Griffiths and celebrating the 30th anniversary of her landmark speech 
in Congress. I want to add my congratulations to her, and her husband 
Hicks Griffiths, and wish them both many more years of good health and 
much happiness.<bullet>
