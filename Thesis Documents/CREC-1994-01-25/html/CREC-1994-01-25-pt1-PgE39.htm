  RECOGNITION OF THE PARKLANE ACADEMY PIONEERS FOR THE TEAM'S FOURTH 
                 STATE 3A ACADEMY FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP

                                 ______


                            HON. MIKE PARKER

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. PARKER. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring a group of outstanding young men, the Parklane Academy Pioneer 
football squad of McComb, MS, and their coaches, supporters, fans, and 
parents on winning the school's fourth Class 3A Mississippi Private 
School Football Championship.
  The Pioneers on November 20, 1993, defeated the Pillow Academy 
Mustangs of Greenwood, MS, in a resounding 35-3 victory. I commend the 
players on both teams for their courage and sportsmanship and fans on 
both sides of the gridiron for their devotion to these young men, their 
schools, and the sport of football.
  Turning the team around from last year's 4-6 record, the Pioneers' 
quest for the crown this season was hindered by only two losses, one of 
which was a 16-0 loss to Pillow Academy during the regular season. The 
Mustangs had achieved a remarkable 12-0 season, making Pillow Academy 
the favorite in the championship game. However, the Pioneers dominated 
the Mustangs in all aspects of the game, playing almost error-free and 
taking home the title.
  One cannot applaud the players without praising their supporters. I 
commend the fans for their unwavering pride and spirit. I salute the 
parents for supporting and encouraging their children and taking the 
responsibility of ensuring the players, cheerleaders, band members, and 
student volunteers are able to attend each practice and game. I praise 
the coaches and teachers for their positive leadership, understanding, 
and guidance in this championship and in their efforts to help all 
students earn academic achievement.
  The Pioneers exemplify the American spirit of competition, fair play, 
and pride. I ask you to join me in saluting the Parklane Pioneers for 
their dedication, positive attitude, and pride.
