    CONGRESS SALUTES HALF CENTURY OF FIREFIGHTING BY GEORGE S. BURCH

                                 ______


                        HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, every year in the rural and suburban 
regions of New York State alone, volunteer firemen save countless lives 
and billions of dollars in property.
  That's why I'd like to say a few words today about George S. Burch, 
who will be celebrating 50 years of volunteer firefighting in 
Cambridge, NY on February 6.
  George Burch joined the Cambridge Volunteer Fire Department on 
January 26, 1944. He was department chief from 1955 to 1957. He also 
served as the Washington County deputy fire coordinator from 1970 to 
1991, and on the Fire Advisory Board from 1958 to 1993.
  I'll admit to having a soft spot in my heart for volunteer firemen, 
since I was one myself for 20 years. I know the sacrifice they make to 
protect the lives and property of their neighbors. I've watched these 
volunteer fire companies update their training and equipment, but the 
bottom line has always been the dedication of the individual 
firefighter. As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing more all-American 
than our volunteer fire companies, and few more admirable citizens than 
those like George Burch, who have been so generous with their time.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask this body to rise with me to salute a great 
American, 50-year firefighter George S. Burch of Cambridge, NY.
