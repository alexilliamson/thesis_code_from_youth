                     TRIBUTE TO DEBRA BRODIE FOSTER

                                 ______


                      HON. GEORGE J. HOCHBRUECKNER

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. HOCHBRUECKNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Debra Brodie 
Foster, an outstanding citizen who recently retired from the East 
Hampton Town Planning Board. Over the past 15 years, Ms. Foster has 
been instrumental in preserving East Hampton's admirable environmental 
record.
  Debra Foster has consistently fought to maintain East Hampton's 
precious resources by striking a balance between development and 
preservation. Ms. Foster's motivation was pure and simple; she 
envisioned an East Hampton in which people could continue to cherish 
and enjoy the environment. Today, Debra's dream is reality as seen 
through East Hampton's clean waterways, dense woodlands, and famous 
beaches.
  Although Ms. Foster has left the town planning board, her legacy 
remains through her work for East Hampton's environment. I am certain 
that Debra Foster's determined leadership will be missed by eastern 
Long Island. I am confident, however, that the East Hampton Town 
Planning Board will continue to follow Ms. Foster's example.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to recognize Debra Brodie 
Foster, chairperson of East Hampton Town Planning Board, for her 
extraordinary efforts on behalf of the environment and her community. I 
wish Debra the best in her future endeavors and I am glad to call her 
my friend.

                          ____________________
