REPRESENTATIVE MEEK HONORS NORTH MIAMI POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER OF THE 
                         YEAR KATHLEEN RUGGIERO

                                 ______


                          HON. CARRIE P. MEEK

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mrs. MEEK. Mr. Speaker, Detective Kathleen Ruggiero of the North 
Miami Police Department was recently selected as 1993 Officer of the 
Year. I am certain you will agree with me that Detective Ruggiero is a 
fitting choice, for she is truly an asset to our community.
  Kathleen Ruggiero is a caring person of extraordinary energy. On the 
job, she singlehandedly runs the North Miami Juvenile Crime Unit. Off 
the job, she has raised 24 foster children, plus 6 of her own. And she 
also finds time to volunteer at more than a half dozen community 
service organizations, such as the Haitian Refugee Center and the 
Special Olympics. The city of North Miami is fortunate to have such 
excellent officers on its police force.
  I want to share with my colleagues an article about Detective 
Ruggiero that appeared in the Miami Herald.
  The article follows:

             [From the Miami Herald, Sunday, Jan. 9, 1994]

  Top Officer Noted for Caring--First Woman To Win North Miami Police 
                              Annual Award

                          (By Olympia Duhart)

       And you thought you were busy.
       Kathleen Ruggiero, a detective with the North Miami Police 
     Department, runs a juvenile unit single-handedly, volunteers 
     at more than half a dozen service organizations, feeds the 
     hungry, gives clothes to the needy and has raised 24 foster 
     children, plus six children of her own. And she still finds 
     time to dote on her three grandchildren.
       ``I just feel that when you want to do things, you always 
     make the time,'' says Ruggiero, 45. ``You put things in a 
     priority category.''
       All that hard work has paid off. Last week, Ruggiero was 
     named 1993 Officer of the Year for the North Miami Police 
     Department. It's the first time the department has named a 
     woman for the award.
       ``She's continuously demonstrated a love for the job and a 
     love for society,'' says North Miami Police Chief Kenneth 
     Each. ``Where she gets the time to do it, I don't know.''
       Ruggiero, with the department for eight years, will be 
     presented with the Officer of the Year award Jan. 26 during a 
     luncheon at the Miami Shores Country Club.
       Nominating members say Ruggiero was an easy choice because 
     of her extraordinary concern for children. Since last May, 
     she has been the sole officer in the department's Juvenile 
     Crimes Unit. In that post, she investigates more than 160 
     cases, from lost children to domestic disputes to sexual 
     batteries.
       Ruggiero's concern for children doesn't stop at the office. 
     There are the 24 foster children she has raised, in addition 
     to her own, and she's known throughout the city for her 
     extensive charity work. On Christmas Eve, Ruggiero played the 
     role of real-life Santa to more than 300 needy families, 
     delivering donated toys to children. She also distributed 
     more than 250 food baskets to families at Thanksgiving.
       Ruggiero volunteers time to too many organizations to list. 
     They include the Haitian Refugee Center, Save the Shoreline, 
     Battered Women and the Special Olympics.
       Ruggiero says helping other people is the main reason she 
     was attracted to police work.
       ``I really thought I could make a difference,'' Ruggiero 
     says. ``I just try to help other people because I've been 
     blessed with so much.''
