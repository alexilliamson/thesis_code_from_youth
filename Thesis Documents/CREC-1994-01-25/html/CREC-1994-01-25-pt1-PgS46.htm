       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Arms 
     Control and Nonproliferation Act of 1994''.
       (b) References in Title.--Except as specifically provided 
     in this title, whenever in this title an amendment or repeal

     SEC. 802. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATIONS; PURPOSE.

       (a) Congressional Declarations.--The Congress declares 
     that--
       (1) a fundamental goal of the United States, particularly 
     in the wake of the highly turbulent and uncertain 
     international situation fostered by the end of the Cold War, 
     the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the resulting 
     emergence of fifteen new independent states, and the 
     revolutionary changes in Eastern Europe, is to eliminate 
     chemical and biological weapons and to reduce and limit the 
     large numbers of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union 
     and, more generally, to prevent the proliferation of weapons 
     of mass destruction and their means of delivery, and of high-
     technology conventional armaments as well as to prevent 
     regional conflicts and conventional arms races; and
       (2) an ultimate goal of the United States continues to be a 
     world in which the use of force is subordinated to the rule 
     of law and international change is achieved peacefully 
     without the danger and burden of destabilizing and costly 
     armaments.
       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is--
       (1) to strengthen the United States Arms Control and 
     Disarmament Agency; and
       (2) to improve congressional oversight of the arms control, 
     nonproliferation, and disarmament activities of the United 
     States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

     formulation.
