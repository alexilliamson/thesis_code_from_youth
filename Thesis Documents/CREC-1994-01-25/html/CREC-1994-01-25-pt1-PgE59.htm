    A SPECIAL SALUTE TO OMAR ALI-BEY--OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP AWARD 
                               RECIPIENT

                                 ______


                           HON. LOUIS STOKES

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, January 25, 1994

  Mr. STOKES. Mr. Speaker, I take pride in saluting an outstanding 
constituent of the 11th Congressional District, Omar Ali-Bey, who is 
the recipient of an Outstanding Leadership Award. On Saturday, January 
29, 1994, a host of elected officials, community leaders, and friends 
will gather to recognize this dedicated human being for his many 
contributions to our community. I am pleased to join in this tribute to 
my friend, Omar Ali-Bey.
  Over the years, Omar Ali-Bey has devoted his efforts to eradicate 
drugs, crime, and violence from the Cleveland community. He has 
spearheaded the development of neighborhood watch programs throughout 
Cleveland's public housing and inner-city areas. Much of Omar's work 
has focused on inner-city gangs and the prevention of gang violence. As 
Chair of the 11th Congressional District caucus, I am particularly 
proud to note his leadership of the Safety and Crime Committee.
  It was his leadership in this capacity that enabled the caucus to 
become involved in matters related to police brutality, racism, and 
providing a forum for aggrieved families such as the Michael Pipkins 
family and others. It was also his leadership which forced the city of 
Cleveland to acknowledge the wrongs perpetrated upon the black 
community when Feckner, a drug dealer, was permitted by the Cleveland 
Police Department to sell drugs in the black community. In many ways, 
Omar Ali-Bey has been the conscience of our community.
  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I want to share with my colleagues and the 
Nation some additional information concerning Omar Ali-Bey and his 
contributions to the Greater Cleveland community. I am proud to salute 
Omar Ali-Bey and I applaud his tireless efforts on behalf of our 
children and the community. I offer my congratulations as he receives 
the Outstanding Leadership Award.

                [From the Outstanding Leadership Awards]

                              Omar Ali-Bey

       ``The goal is to stop the killing. The goal is to stop the 
     violence. The goal is unity in the community. The goal is 
     overcoming our illusions of differences whether we are Muslim 
     or Christian or Democrat or Republican or Vice Lord or Folk 
     or Crip or Blood . . .''
       Activist Omar Ali-Bey, sustained by his unyielding faith in 
     God, has dedicated his life to making the quality of life in 
     Cleveland's inner city better for African-Americans, 
     including those who are ex-convicts, drug addicts, and gang 
     members. In his unrelenting quest to instill pride and a 
     sense of cultural identity in those who are disenfranchised, 
     Ali-Bey tirelessly volunteers his time in many organizations.
       Ali-Bey is co-founder of Peace in the Hood, an organization 
     whose purpose is to facilitate peace among the gangs so that 
     their problems can be resolved without violence. In June, 
     1993, Ali-Bey assisted in bringing a national peace summit to 
     Cleveland to address the problem of gang violence. Ali-Bey 
     stated, ``The goal is to stop the killing. The goal is to 
     stop the violence. The goal is overcoming our illusions of 
     differences whether we are Muslim or Christian or Democrat or 
     Republican or Vice Lord or Folk or Crip or Blood. No. We are 
     an African family. PERIOD.''
       Ali-Bey is proud that this organization has helped some 
     gang members to voluntarily join drug patrols that work to 
     stop drug trafficking.
       Also, Ali-Bey is co-founder of ADAM Rites of Passage, a 
     program that focuses on teaching pride, morals and 
     empowerment to African-American youth. ADAM is an acronym for 
     Action Strategies for the Development of All Mankind. Ali-Bey 
     volunteers four days a week to this program in some of 
     Cleveland's public schools, and also advises youth about the 
     danger of drugs and sex.
       In addition to his volunteerism, Ali-Bey is employed by 
     Wings of Hope, a crime reduction program sponsored by the 
     Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
       Ali-Bey serves as a drug and gang prevention specialist at 
     housing projects of Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority 
     (CMHA). In that capacity, Ali-Bey heads the Anti-Drug Patrol 
     which consists of eighteen young men who volunteer their 
     services.
       Ali-Bey's dedication, sensitivity, and motivation stem, in 
     part, from his past personal experiences of incarceration and 
     drug abuse. He has unselfishly shared his time and life 
     experiences to help those similarly situated, and to help 
     others avoid similar pitfalls. Ali-Bey is driven by his 
     desire to help exconvicts and former drug addicts make a 
     meaningful ``contribution back to society.''
       Although Ali-Bey dropped out of Cleveland's East Technical 
     High School in the 11th grade, he has since earned his GED, 
     and two associate degrees in business management and in 
     marketing from Cuyahoga Community College. Ali-Bey earned a 
     bachelor's degree in marketing from Dyke College.
       Ali-Bey takes pride in being Chairman of the Board of H&S 
     International Distributions, Inc. which distributes 
     antimicrobial products known as Germ Stoppers. The company 
     created an economic improvement program to expose African-
     American youth to entrepreneurial training.
       Ali-Bey is very proud to have served as the Chairman of the 
     Safety and Crime Committee of the 11th Congressional District 
     Caucus for the past eight years.
       Ali-Bey, a member of the Islamic faith, stated that he will 
     continue pursuing his goals simply ``for the salvation of the 
     children.'' Regardless of one's religious affiliation, Ali-
     Bey welcomes the assistance of anyone who has similar desires 
     and concerns. He summarized his efforts as, ``Every day that 
     I breathe, I try to make a difference. I know that I'm just 
     one man, but one man and God is a majority.''
       Omar Ali-Bey is held in high esteem by the Greater 
     Cleveland community, the state, and indeed the nation.
       Ali-Bey and his wife, Kalima, are the proud parents of five 
     children.
